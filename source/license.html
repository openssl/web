            OpenSSL is covered by one of two licenses, depending on which
            release is involved.  In all cases, there is a file named
            <code>LICENSE</code> in the top-level of the release.
            Copies can also be found here.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the 1.1.1 release, and later releases derived from that,
            <a href="license-asf.txt">the Apache v2 license</a>
            applies.
            This also applies to the release branch for this
            version, and the git "master" branch.
            </p>
            <p>
            For any release made before OpenSSL 1.1.1 (namely
            the 1.1.0, 1.0.2, and all prior releases including those
            not currently supported),
            <a href="license-ssleay.txt">the OpenSSL license</a>
            applies.
            Note that this is also true for any updates to those
            releases -- the "letter suffix" --  no matter when they are made.
            It also applies to the git branches for all those
            releases, and to any public forks that have not rebased to
            master (or 1.1.1).
