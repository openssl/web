# Git Repository

The OpenSSL software is developed using a git repository. The
repository is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/openssl/openssl>.

## Git branch names and tagging

The *master* branch, also known as the development branch, contains the
latest bleeding edge code. There are also several *stable* branches
where stable releases come from. These take the form
*OpenSSL\_x\_y\_z-stable* so, for example, the 1.1.0 stable branch is
*OpenSSL\_1\_1\_0-stable*. When an actual release is made it is tagged
in the form *OpenSSL\_x\_y\_zp* or a beta *OpenSSL\_x\_y\_xp-betan*,
though you should normally just download the release tarball. Tags and
branches are occasionally used for other purposes such as testing
experimental or unstable code before it is merged into another branch.
