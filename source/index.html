	    <p>Our development is maintained in a
	    <a href="gitrepo.html">git repository</a>, which is
	    accessible over the network and cloned on GitHub,
            at <a
              href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">https://github.com/openssl/openssl</a>.

	    <p>The table below lists the latest releases for every branch.
            (For an explanation of the numbering, see our
            <a href="/policies/releasestrat.html">release strategy</a>.)
	    All releases can be found at
	    <a href="old">/source/old</a>.
	    A list of mirror sites can be found <a href="mirror.html">here</a>.
	    </p>

	    <p><em>Note:</em> The latest stable version is the 1.1.0 series of
	    releases. Also available is the 1.0.2 series. This is also our Long Term
	    Support (LTS) version (support will be provided until 31st December
	    2019). The 0.9.8, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 versions are now out of support and
	    should not be used.</p>

	    <p>When building a release for the first time, please make sure
	    to look at the README and INSTALL files in the distribution.
	    If you have problems, look at the FAQ, which can also be
	    found <a href="/docs/faq.html">online</a>.</p>

	    <p>PGP keys for the signatures are available from the
	    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html">OMC page</a>.
	    Current members that sign releases include Richard Levitte, Stephen
	    Henson and Matt Caswell.

	    <p>
	    Each day we make a snapshot of each development branch.
	    They can be found at
	    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/">https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/</a>.
            These daily snapshots of the source tree are provided for
            convenience only and not even guaranteed to compile.  Note that
            keeping a git local repository and updating it every 24 hours
            is equivalent and will often be faster and more efficient.</p>
