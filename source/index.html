	    <p>The master sources are maintained in our
	    <a href="gitrepo.html">git repository</a>, which is
	    accessible over the network and cloned on GitHub,
            at <a
              href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">https://github.com/openssl/openssl</a>.
            Bugs and pull patches (issues and pull requests) should be
            filed on the GitHub repo.
	    Please familiarize yourself with the

	    <p>The table below lists the latest releases for every branch.
            (For an explanation of the numbering, see our
            <a href="/policies/releasestrat.html">release strategy</a>.)
	    All releases can be found at
	    <a href="old">/source/old</a>.
	    A list of mirror sites can be found <a href="mirror.html">here</a>.
	    </p>

	    <p><em>Note:</em> The latest stable version is the 1.1.1 series. This is
        also our Long Term Support (LTS) version, supported until 11th September
        2023. Our previous LTS version (1.0.2 series) will continue to be
        supported until 31st December 2019 (security fixes only during the last
        year of support). The 1.1.0 series is currently only receiving security
        fixes and will go out of support on 11th September 2019. All users of
        1.0.2 and 1.1.0 are encouraged to upgrade to 1.1.1 as soon as possible.
        The 0.9.8, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 versions are now out of support and should
        not be used.</p>

        <p>The OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 2.0 (FOM) is also available for
        download. It is no longer receiving updates. It must be used in
        conjunction with a FIPS capable version of OpenSSL (1.0.2 series). A
        new FIPS module is currently in development.</p>

	    <p>When building a release for the first time, please make sure
	    to look at the INSTALL file in the distribution along with any NOTES
        file applicable to your platform. If you have problems, look at the FAQ,
        which can be found <a href="/docs/faq.html">online</a>. If you
        still need more help, then join the
        <a href="/community/mailinglists.html">openssl-users</a> email list and
        post a question there.</p>

	    <p>PGP keys for the signatures are available from the
	    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html">OMC page</a>.
	    Current members that sign releases include Richard Levitte and
	    Matt Caswell.

	    <p>
	    Each day we make a snapshot of each development branch.
	    They can be found at
	    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/">https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/</a>.
            These daily snapshots of the source tree are provided for
            convenience only and not even guaranteed to compile.  Note that
            keeping a git local repository and updating it every 24 hours
            is equivalent and will often be faster and more efficient.</p>
