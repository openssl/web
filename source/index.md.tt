# Downloads

The master sources are maintained in our [git repository](gitrepo.html),
which is accessible over the network and cloned on GitHub, at
<https://github.com/openssl/openssl>. Bugs and pull patches (issues and
pull requests) should be filed on the GitHub repo. Please familiarize
yourself with the [license](license.html).

The table below lists the latest releases for every branch. (For an explanation
of the numbering, see our [release strategy](/policies/releasestrat.html).)
All releases can be found at [/source/old](old).

*Note:* The latest stable version is the 3.2 series supported until 23rd
November 2025. Also available is the 3.1 series supported until 14th March
2025, and the 3.0 series which is a Long Term Support (LTS) version and is
supported until 7th September 2026. All older versions (including 1.1.1, 1.1.0,
1.0.2, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8) are now out of support and should not be used. Users of
these older versions are encouraged to upgrade to 3.2 or 3.0 as soon as
possible. Extended support for 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 to gain access to security fixes
for those versions is [available](/support/contracts.html).

The following OpenSSL version(s) are FIPS validated. Versions marked as historic
were previously validated, but are no longer listed on the current certificate:

&nbsp;OpenSSL Version&nbsp; | &nbsp;Certificate&nbsp; | &nbsp;Security Policy&nbsp;
:-: | :-: | :-:
3.0.9 | [certificate][cert4282] | [security policy][secpol 3.0.9]
3.0.8 | [certificate][cert4282] | [security policy][secpol 3.0.8]
3.0.0 (historic) | [certificate][cert4282] | [security policy][secpol 3.0.0]

[cert4282]: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4282
[secpol 3.0.0]: fips-doc/openssl-3.0.0-security-policy-2023-01-26.pdf
[secpol 3.0.8]: fips-doc/openssl-3.0.8-security-policy-2023-05-05.pdf

For a list of CVEs and their impact on validated FIPS providers, visit the
[CVEs and FIPS](/news/fips-cve.html) page.

Please follow the Security Policy instructions to download, build and
install a validated OpenSSL FIPS provider.
Other OpenSSL Releases MAY use the validated FIPS provider, but
MUST NOT build and use their own FIPS provider. For example you can build
OpenSSL 3.2 and use the OpenSSL 3.0.8 FIPS provider with it.

Information about how to configure and use the FIPS provider in your
applications is available on the FIPS module man page.
You must also read the module security policy and follow the specific
build and installation instructions included in it.

For an overview of some of the key concepts in OpenSSL 3.2 see the
[OpenSSL Guide](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man7/ossl-guide-introduction.html).
Much of the information in the guide is also applicable to older releases such
as 3.1 and 3.0 except for sections relating to new features only in 3.2 (such
as QUIC). Information and notes about migrating existing applications to OpenSSL
3.2 (and 3.1/3.0) are available in the [OpenSSL 3.2 Migration
Guide](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man7/migration_guide.html)

When building a release for the first time, please make sure to look at
the INSTALL file in the distribution along with any NOTES file
applicable to your platform. If you have problems, then join the
[openssl-users](/community/mailinglists.html) email list and post a
question there.

PGP keys for the signatures are available from the
[OTC page](https://www.openssl.org/community/otc.html). Current members that
sign releases include Richard Levitte, Matt Caswell, Paul Dale, and Tomas Mraz.

The releases can be also signed by the OpenSSL OMC key with fingerprint
[EFC0 A467 D613 CB83 C7ED 6D30 D894 E2CE 8B3D 79F5].

Each day we make a snapshot of each development branch. They can be
found at <https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/>. These daily
snapshots of the source tree are provided for convenience only and not
even guaranteed to compile. Note that keeping a git local repository and
updating it every 24 hours is equivalent and will often be faster and
more efficient.
