# License

OpenSSL is covered by one of two licenses, depending on which release is
involved. In all cases, there is a file named `LICENSE` in the top-level
of the release. Copies can also be found here.

For the 3.0 release, and later releases derived from that,
[the Apache License v2](apache-license-2.0.txt) applies. This also
applies to the git "master" branch.

For any release made before OpenSSL 3.0 (namely the 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.2,
and all prior releases including those not currently supported),
[the dual OpenSSL and SSLeay license](license-openssl-ssleay.txt) applies.
Note that this is also true for any updates to those releases -- the
"letter suffix" -- no matter when they are made. It also applies to
the git branches for all those releases, and to any public forks that
have not rebased to master (or 3.0).
