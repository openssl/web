# OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Private Label Validations

If you haven't already, please read our
[FIPS 140-2 Notes](/docs/fipsnotes.html) page.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The addition of multiple new formal requirements
since the #1747 validation was first approved in 2012, and recent
unfavorable experiences with increasingly unpredictable outcomes from
the validation process, have increased to the point where private label
validations are no longer economically feasible for a small organization
of limited means; the risk doesn't justify the substantial investment
of time and money required to pursue new validations. As of 2015 we are
no longer performing any private label validations.

We will be starting work on a new FIPS validation soon.
