	    Nothing will make sense otherwise (it still may not afterwards,
	    but at least you've a better chance).</p>

	    <p>No new validations are currently planned.</p>

	    <h3>FIPS What?  Where Do I Start?</h3>

	    <p>Ok, so your company needs FIPS validated cryptography to land
	    that big sale, and your product currently uses OpenSSL. You
	    haven't worked up the motivation to wade through the entire <a
	    href="fips/UserGuide.pdf">User Guide</a> and want the quick "executive
	    summary".  Here is a grossly oversimplified account:</p>
	    <p>

	    <ul>

	      <li>OpenSSL itself is not validated.  Instead
	      a special carefully defined software component called the
	      OpenSSL FIPS Object Module has been created.  This Module was
	      designed for compatibility with OpenSSL so that products using
	      the OpenSSL API can be converted to use validated cryptography
	      with minimal effort.</li>

	      <li>The OpenSSL FIPS Object Module validation is unique among
	      all FIPS 140-2 validations in that the product is "delivered" in
	      source code form, meaning that if you can use it exactly as is
	      and can build it (according to the very specific documented
	      instructions) for your platform, then you can use it as
	      validated cryptography on a "vendor affirmed" basis.</li>

	      <li>If even the tiniest source code or build process changes are
	      required for your intended application, you cannot use the open
	      source based validated module directly.  You must obtain your
	      own validation.</li>

	    </ul>

	    <p>Note that FIPS 140-2 validation is a complicated topic that the
	    above summary does not adequately address.  You have been
	    warned!</p>

	    <h2><a name="privatelabel">The "Private Label" Validation</a></h2>

	    <p>We refer to validations based directly on the OpenSSL FIPS
	    Object Module as "private label" validations.  These are also
	    sometimes referred to as "cookie cutter" validations.  The usual
	    reason for such separate validations is the need for small
	    modifications which forces a complete new validation, but some
	    vendors, for marketing or risk management reasons, have obtained
	    private label validations for binaries produced from unmodified
	    (or only cosmetically modified) source code.</p>

	    <p><strong>Update:</strong> As of 2015 we are no longer performing private label validations. We are still adding new platforms to the <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm#1747">#1747</a>
	    or related validations.</p>

	    <h3>Current Validations</h3>

	    <p> The most recent open source based validation is the FIPS 140-2
	    certificate <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm#1747">#1747</a>.
	    You will need the <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140sp/140sp1747.pdf">Security Policy</a>
	    and <a href="/source/openssl-fips-2.0.tar.gz">source</a>
	    at a minimum. And did we mention the
	    <a href="fips/UserGuide.pdf">User Guide</a>?</p>

	    <h3>Performance at Startup</h3>

	    <p>We have had many complaints about poor performance of the
	    Power-On Self Test (POST) on low powered computers, as with some
	    embedded devices. In the worst cases the POST can take several
	    minutes. Such devices were not included as test platforms at the
	    time the code was originally written.</p>
	    <p>The current FIPS validated code performs a very comprehensive
	    set of mandatory algorithm self tests when it enter FIPS mode
	    covering many algorithm combinations. There is a DSA parameter
	    generation self test which is especially CPU intensive.</p>
	    <p>As a result of the POST performance issue we revisited the KAT
	    (Known Answer Test) requirements in the POST process that were
	    burning up most of those cycle.  In consultation with a CMVP test
	    lab we determined that it should be possible to substantially
	    reduce that performance penalty in a new validation.
	    Unfortunately such a change can only be undertaken in the context
	    of a new validation, and not as a change letter modification.</p>
	    <p>Another factor affecting performance is the use (or not) of
	    platform specific optimizations.  The x86/x64 Windows and Linux
	    code makes use of assembly language optimizations for FIPS
	    cryptographic algorithms. The C only version is much slower and so
	    the POST is slower too.</p>
