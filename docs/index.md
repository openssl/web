# Documentation

The [frequently-asked questions (FAQ)](faq.html) page is available.

A good starting point for understanding some of the key concepts in
OpenSSL 3.0 is the libcrypto
[manual page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/crypto.html).
Information and notes about migrating existing applications to OpenSSL
3.0 are available in the
[OpenSSL 3.0 Migration Guide](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/migration_guide.html)

The [manual pages](manpages.html) for all supported releases are
available.

Ivan RistiÄ‡, the creator of <https://ssllabs.com>, has a free download
of his *OpenSSL Cookbook* that covers the most frequently used OpenSSL
features and commands. It is updated often, and is available at
<https://www.feistyduck.com/books/openssl-cookbook/>. It is highly
recommended.

Historic information about our legacy OpenSSL FIPS Object Module (FOM)
2.0 [FIPS 140-2 validation](fips.html) is also available.
