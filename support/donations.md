# Sponsorship and Donations

The OpenSSL project relies on funding to maintain and improve OpenSSL.

You can support the OpenSSL project financially with the purchase of a
[support contract](contracts.html), or by a sponsorship donation.

We can accept smaller sponsorship donations via
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/openssl).

We do not have a PayPal account. Please do not donate to any PayPal
account claiming to be associated with us!

Please note that the [OpenSSL Software Foundation](/community/contacts.html)
(OSF) is incorporated in the the state of Delaware, United States, as a
non-profit corporation. It does not qualify as a tax-exempt charitable
organisation under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.

We provide [Acknowledgements for sponsors](acks.html) depending on the level
of funding:
