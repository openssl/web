# Support Contracts

In addition to [community](/community) support,
[OpenSSL Software Services](/community/contacts.html) offers three different
types of support contract. If you have specific requirements not addressed
by any of these plans, or for more information, please contact us at
<osf-contact@openssl.org> to discuss custom arrangements.

Please see the [list of definitions](#definitions) at the bottom of the page
for the definitions used below.

[Premium](#premium) Enterprise Level Support
:   Designed for the large enterprise utilising OpenSSL extensively in
    product lines or critical infrastructure.

[Vendor](#vendor) Support
:   Designed for organisations requiring support of product lines using
    OpenSSL or for customised in-house versions of OpenSSL.

[Basic](#basic) Support
:   Basic technical support for application development shops or end
    users.

## <a name="premium">Premium Level Support</a>

US\$50,000 annually

-   A support contract designed to meet the needs of Enterprise customers
-   Provides extended support for LTS releases (including 1.0.2) beyond
    the public EOL date for as long as it remains commercially viable to
    do so.
-   Extended support includes provision of security fixes

The premium support plan is intended for the large enterprise using
OpenSSL as an essential component of multiple products or product lines
or in support of in-house or commercially provided services. The typical
large enterprise customer has a capable in-house technical staff but
still finds it cost-effective to engage OpenSSL authors and maintainers
directly.

## <a name="vendor">Vendor Level Support</a>

US\$25,000 annually

-   Email response
-   Limit of four Service Requests per month
-   Patch preparation
-   Two Support Administrators

This plan is designed for the medium enterprise using OpenSSL for a
single product or product line. The prospective Vendor Level Support
customer has a proficient technical staff but no specific expertise in
cryptography or OpenSSL.

## <a name="basic">Basic Support</a>

US\$15,000 annually

-   Email response
-   Limit of one Service Requests per month
-   One Support Administrator

This plan is designed for the medium to small enterprise relying on
standard OpenSSL for significant products or services and lacking
internal resources for effectively addressing all operational and
application development issues.

## <a name="definitions">Support Terms</a>

Patch Preparation
:   The preparation of a patch changeset from existing changes committed
    to the OpenSSL source code repository.

Service Request
:   A specific request for support initiated by a Support Administrator
    and assigned a service request number by the OSF.

Support Administrator
:   An individual designated by the customer to submit requests for
    technical support to the OSF. The number of individuals that can be
    designated as support administrators varies with the support plan
    option. The support administrator may be a Customer Contact in the
    context of a specific Service Request, or may designate a Customer
    Contact for Service Requests.
