	    <p>In addition to <a href="/community">community</a> support,
	    <a href="/community/contacts.html">OpenSSL Software Services</a>
	    offers three different types of support contract.  If you
	    have specific requirements not addressed by any of these plans,
	    or for more information, please contact us at
	    <a href="mailto:osf-contact@openssl.org">osf-contact@openssl.org</a> to
	    discuss custom arrangements.</p>

	    <p>Please see the <a href="#definitions">list of definitions</a>
	    at the bottom of the page for the definitions used below.</p>

	    <dl>
	      <dt><a href="#premium">Premium</a>
	      Enterprise Level Support</dt>
	      <dd>Designed for the large enterprise utilising OpenSSL
	      extensively in product lines or critical infrastructure.</dd>
	      <dt><a href="#vendor">Vendor</a> Support</dt>
	      <dd>Designed for organisations requiring support of product
	      lines using OpenSSL or for customised in-house versions of
	      OpenSSL.</dd>
	      <dt><a href="#basic">Basic</a> Support<dt>
	      <dd>Basic technical support for application development shops or
	      end users.</dd>

	    <h3><a name="premium">Premium Level Support</a></h3>
	    <p>US$50,000 annually</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>A custom support contract designed to meet the needs of a specific Enterprise customer
	      <li>Includes extended support for the immediately previous LTS release
	      beyond the public EOL date for that release
	      <li>Exact costs will depend on the terms of the agreed support contract
	    </ul>
	    <p>The premium support plan is intended for the large enterprise
	    using OpenSSL as an essential component of multiple products or
	    product lines or in support of in-house or commercially provided
	    services. The typical large enterprise customer has a capable in-house
	    technical staff but still finds it cost-effective to engage OpenSSL
	    authors and maintainers directly.</p>

	    <h3><a name="vendor">Vendor Level Support</a></h3>
	    <p>US$25,000 annually</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Email response
	      <li>Limit of four Service Requests per month
	      <li>Patch preparation
	      <li>Two Support Administrators
	    </ul>
	    <p>This plan is designed for the medium enterprise using OpenSSL
	    for a single product or product line. The prospective Vendor Level
	    Support customer has a proficient technical staff but no specific
	    expertise in cryptography or OpenSSL.</p>

	    <h3><a name="basic">Basic Support</a></h3>
	    <p>US$15,000 annually</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Email response
	      <li>Limit of one Service Requests per month
	      <li>One Support Administrator
	    </ul>
	    <p>This plan is designed for the medium to small enterprise
	    relying on standard OpenSSL for significant products or services and
	    lacking internal resources for effectively addressing all
	    operational and application development issues.</p>

	    <h3><a name="definitions">Support Terms</a></h3>
	    <dl>
	      <dt>Patch Preparation</dt>
	      <dd>The preparation of a patch changeset from existing changes
	      committed to the OpenSSL source code repository.</dd>

	      <dt>Service Request</dt>
	      <dd>A specific request for support initiated by a Support
	      Administrator and assigned a service request number by the
	      OSF.</dd>

	      <dt>Support Administrator</dt>
	      <dd>An individual designated by the customer to submit requests
	      for technical support to the OSF.  The number of individuals
	      that can be designated as support administrators varies with the
	      support plan option.  The support administrator may be a
	      Customer Contact in the context of a specific Service Request,
	      or may designate a Customer Contact for Service Requests.</dd>
