# Code of Conduct

The OpenSSL community consists primarily, although not solely, of its online
presence in mailing lists and activities such as the blog postings and
comments, the GitHub repository, and so on. These outlets are managed by the
OpenSSL Management Committee, whose members are listed here:
[https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html](omc.html)

We strive to be an open and inclusive community where anyone can contribute.
Contributions should be judged on their own merits; we don't care about your
gender identity, race, political beliefs, age, or similar attributes.

If we see that one or more members of the community are generally abusive,
harassing others, or seem to be trying to intimidate them into leaving the
community, we will first ask those who are doing so to take a break from
participation for a while. If you see any evidence of such activity, please
let us know by sending email to <conduct@openssl.org>.
