          <p>The OpenSSL community consists primarily, although not solely, of
          its online presence in mailing lists and activities such as the blog
          postings and comments, the GitHub repository, and so on. These
          outlets are managed by the OpenSSL Management Committee, whose
          members are listed here:
          <a href="omc.html">https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html</a>
          </p>

          <p>We strive to be an open and inclusive community where anyone can
          contribute. Contributions should be judged on their own merits; we
          don't care about your gender identity, race, political beliefs, age,
          or similar attributes.</p>

          <p>If we see that one or more members of the community are generally
          abusive, harassing others, or seem to be trying to intimidate them
          into leaving the community, we will first ask those who are doing so
          to take a break from participation for a while. If you see any
          evidence of such activity, please let us know by sending email to
          <a href="mailto:conduct@openssl.org">conduct@openssl.org</a>.</p>
