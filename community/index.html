            OpenSSL source is maintained by a
            <a href="committers.html">team of committers</a>.
            The overall project is run by the
            <a href="omc.html">OpenSSL Management Committee</a>.
            We operate under a set of
            <a href="/policies/omc-bylaws.html">project bylaws</a>
            and ask everyone to follow our
            <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some of the ways you can join the community and
            contribute; see the links on the right-hand side.
            The "<a href="getting-started.html">getting started</a>"
            page has some ideas.
	    We maintain several <a href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>.
	    Anyone can join, but you must be a member of a list to post to it.
	    We have a <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org">public wiki</a>,
	    and anyone can request an account and start adding content.
	    We have a <a href="/blog">team blog</a>, where members of
	    the development team will occasionally post.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    While we only distribute source, some members of the community
	    make <a href="binaries.html">binaries</a> available.
	    </p>

            <p>
            Finally we'd also like to <a href="thanks.html">thank</a>
            several groups for help with the project infrastructure over time.

            <h3 id="securityreports">Reporting Security Bugs</h3>

            <p>If you think you have found a security bug in OpenSSL,
            please send mail to <a
              href="mailto:openssl-security@openssl.org">openssl-security@openssl.org</a>.
            Encryption is not required, but if you want to encrypt the mail, you can use our
            team's <a href="/news/pgpkey.html">PGP Key</a>.  Or you can
            send mail to one or more individual <a
              href="/community/omc.html">OMC Members</a>,
            encrypted or plaintext.
            We will work with you to assess and fix the flaw,
            as discussed in our
            <a href="/policies/secpolicy.html">Security Policy</a>.</p>

            <p>
            Please note that we do not run a Bug Bounty program, although third parties
            may reward confirmed security issues reported in the OpenSSL codebase.  We
            do not consider
            the <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6077">lack of SPF records for openssl.org</a> a security issue.
            </p>

            <p>
            All fixed security bugs are listed on our <a href="/news/vulnerabilities.html">vulnerabilities page</a>
            </p>

            <h3 id="bugs">Reporting Bugs</h3>

	    <p>To report a bug or make an enhancement request, please open
            an issue on GitHub, by clicking "new issue" on this page:
            <a
              href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues</a>.
            If you also have code, you do not need to open both an issue and
            a pull request.</p>

            <p>For more information about the best way to submit patches,
            please see the file CONTRIBUTING in the distribution.
            The short answer is 
            <a
              href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pulls">make a pull request</a>.
