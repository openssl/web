	    OpenSSL is a a collaborative effort of a worldwide community of
            volunteers that has a <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some of the ways you can join the
	    community and contribute.
	    We'd also like
	    to <a href="thanks.html">thank</a> several groups for help with
	    the project infrastructure over time.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    We maintain several <a href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>.
	    Anyone can join, but you must be a member of a list to post to it.
	    We have a <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org">public wiki</a>,
	    and anyone can request an account and start adding content.
	    We have a <a href="/blog">team blog</a>, where members of
	    the development team will occasionally post.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    While we only distribute source, some members of the community
	    make <a href="binaries.html">binaries</a> available.

            <h3><a href="#bugs">Reporting Bugs</a></h3>

            <p>We are in the process of changing to do "everything" on
            GitHub.  Please see our
            <a
              href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/10/12/f2f-rt-github/">blog post</a>
            for some details and background.

	    <p>If you think have found a security bug, please see our
	    <a href="/news/vulnerabilities.html">vulnerabilities page</a>
	    for information on how to report it.</p>

	    <p>To report a bug or make an enhancement request, please open
            an issue on GitHub, by clicking "new issue" on this page:
            <a
              href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues</a>.
            If you also have code, you do not need to open both an issue and
            a pull request.</p>

            <p>For more information about the best way to submit patches,
            please see the file CONTRIBUTING in the distribution.
