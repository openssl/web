# sample .ttreerc file created automatically by ttree version 2.9
#
# This file originally written to /home/vavrat/.ttreerc
#
# For more information on the contents of this configuration file, see
# 
#     perldoc ttree
#     ttree -h
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The most flexible way to use ttree is to create a separate directory 
# for configuration files and simply use the .ttreerc to tell ttree where
# it is.  
#
#     cfg = /path/to/ttree/config/directory

# print summary of what's going on 
verbose 

# recurse into any sub-directories and process files
recurse

# regexen of things that aren't templates and should be ignored
ignore = \b(CVS|RCS)\b
ignore = ^#
ignore = ^\.(inc|cross)

# ditto for things that should be copied rather than processed.
copy = \.png$ 
copy = \.gif$ 

# ditto for things that should be linked rather than copied / processed.
# link = \.flv$ 

# by default, everything not ignored or copied is accepted; add 'accept'
# lines if you want to filter further. e.g.
#
#    accept = \.html$
#    accept = \.tt2$
accept = \.md\.tt$

# options to rewrite files suffixes (htm => html, tt2 => html)
#
#    suffix htm=html
#    suffix tt2=html
    suffix md.tt=html

# options to define dependencies between templates
#
#    depend *=header,footer,menu
#    depend index.html=mainpage,sidebar
#    depend menu=menuitem,menubar
# 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options usually relate to a particular project so 
# you'll probably want to put them in a separate configuration file 
# in the directory specified by the 'cfg' option and then invoke tree 
# using '-f' to tell it which configuration you want to use.
# However, there's nothing to stop you from adding default 'src',
# 'dest' or 'lib' options in the .ttreerc.  The 'src' and 'dest' options
# can be re-defined in another configuration file, but be aware that 'lib' 
# options accumulate so any 'lib' options defined in the .ttreerc will
# be applied every time you run ttree.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# # directory containing source page templates
# src = /path/to/your/source/page/templates
#
# # directory where output files should be written
# dest = /path/to/your/html/output/directory
# 
# # additional directories of library templates
# lib = /first/path/to/your/library/templates
# lib = /second/path/to/your/library/templates
