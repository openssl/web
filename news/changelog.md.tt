# Changelog

When a release is created, that branch is forked off, and its changelog
is also forked. For example, none of the changes after 0.9.8n appear in
the other logs, because 1.0.0 was created after that release and before
0.9.8o. Any changes that are merged across branches, however, should
have an entry in each branch's changelog.

This is the changelog for the master branch, the one that is currently
in active development. The plain-text / markdown version of this
document is available here: [changelog.txt](changelog.txt)

For other branches, the changelogs are distributed with the source, but
are also available here:

[% FOREACH release IN releases.split('\s+').reverse -%]
-   [[% release %]](cl[% release.replace('\.', '') %].txt)
[% END -%]
