Timing-based attacks on SSL/TLS with CBC encryption

[*] OpenSSL 0.9.6i and OpenSSL 0.9.7a do not require this patch.

The source code of OpenSSL 0.9.6i and OpenSSL 0.9.7a is available as
files openssl-0.9.6i.tar.gz and openssl-0.9.7a.tar.gz from

     ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source;type=d

(If you were previously using an OpenSSL 0.9.6* "engine" release and
cannot upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7a, obtain file
openssl-engine-0.9.6i.tar.gz instead.  With OpenSSL 0.9.7, the
"engine" framework has become part of the standard distribution.)

If you are using a pre-compiled OpenSSL package, please look for update
information from the respective software distributor.  The OpenSSL
group itself does not distribute OpenSSL binaries.


Vulnerability
-------------

In an upcoming paper, Brice Canvel (EPFL), Alain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge
Vaudenay (EPFL), and Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL, Ilion) describe and
demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites in SSL and TLS.

The attack assumes that multiple SSL or TLS connections involve a
common fixed plaintext block, such as a password.  An active attacker
can substitute specifically made-up ciphertext blocks for blocks sent
by legitimate SSL/TLS parties and measure the time until a response
arrives: SSL/TLS includes data authentication to ensure that such
modified ciphertext blocks will be rejected by the peer (and the
connection aborted), but the attacker may be able to use timing
observations to distinguish between two different error cases, namely
block cipher padding errors and MAC verification errors.  This is
sufficient for an adaptive attack that finally can obtain the complete
plaintext block.

OpenSSL version since 0.9.6c supposedly treat block cipher padding
errors like MAC verification errors during record decryption
(see http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt), but MAC verification
was still skipped after detection of a padding error, which allowed
the timing attack.  (Note that it is likely that other SSL/TLS
implementations will have similar problems.)

OpenSSL 0.9.6i and 0.9.7a perform a MAC computation even if incorrrect
block cipher padding has been found to minimize information leaked via
timing.  For earlier versions starting with 0.9.6e, the enclosed
security patch can be used.


Source code patch
-----------------

If upgrading to OpenSSL 0.9.7a (the recommended version) or to OpenSSL
0.9.6i is not immediately possible, the following patch should be
applied to the OpenSSL source code tree.  The patch is compatible
with OpenSSL 0.9.6e and later.
