            When a release is created, that branch is forked off, and its
            changelog is also forked. For example, none of the changes
            after 0.9.8n appear in the other logs, because 1.0.0 was
            created after that release and before 0.9.8o. Any changes that
            are merged across branches, however, should have an entry
            in each branch's changelog.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is the changelog for the master branch, the one that is
            currently in active development.
	    The plain-text version of this document is available
	    here: <a href="changelog.txt">changelog.txt</a>
            </p>
	    </p>
            For other branches, the changelogs are distributed with
            the source, but are also available here:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="cl101.txt">1.0.1</a></li>
              <li><a href="cl102.txt">1.0.2</a></li>
              <li><a href="cl110.txt">1.1.0</a></li>
            </ul>
