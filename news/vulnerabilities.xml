    <description>
      This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug
      causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released
      as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact
      of the bug was not known at the time.

      In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero
      represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow
      with an out-of-bounds write in i2c_ASN1_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does
      not normally create "negative zeroes" when parsing ASN.1 input, and
      therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug.

      However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser
      (specifically, d2i_ASN1_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag
      as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any
      common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY
      structures.

      Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures
      containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may
      be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to
      cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some
      malloc implementations.

      Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to
      be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509
      certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with
      valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the
      bug. Specifically, since OpenSSL's default TLS X509 chain verification
      code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes
      could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted
      Certification Authorities.

      A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic
      when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support
      AES-NI.

      This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding
      attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in
      constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and
      compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer
      checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding
      bytes.

      An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for
      Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very
      large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in
      a heap corruption.

      Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the
      PEM_write_bio* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL
      command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable
      because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible.
      User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted
      data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the
      PEM_write_bio* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit
      message. This is no longer believed to be the case).

      An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker
      is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call
      to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can
      overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all
      OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is
      one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is
      known to be the first called function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and
      therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the
      length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some
      small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since
      all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be
      no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that
      EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths.
      Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All
      instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed
      there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur.

      This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls
      this function directly.

      When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio()
      a short invalid encoding can casuse allocation of large amounts of memory
      potentially consuming excessive resources or exhausting memory.

      Any application parsing untrusted data through d2i BIO functions is
      affected. The memory based functions such as d2i_X509() are *not*
      affected. Since the memory based functions are used by the TLS library,
      TLS applications are not affected.

    <description>
      A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS
      sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a
      Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.  Note that traffic between clients and
      non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting
      SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or
      POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is
      known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800).

      Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50
      computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more
      efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers
      using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on
      19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below).

      Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS
      servers, if they've not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also
      sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and
      1.0.2f) have been deployed.  Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol,
      and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2
      ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of
      SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers.

      OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN:

      SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time.  Builds that are not configured
      with "enable-ssl2" will not support SSLv2.  Even if "enable-ssl2" is used,
      users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23_method() will
      need to explicitly call either of:

         SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);
         or
         SSL_clear_options(ssl, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);

      as appropriate.  Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly
      uses the version-specific SSLv2_method() or its client or server variants,
      SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed.
      Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no
      longer available.

      In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of
      OpenSSL.  Builds that are not configured with "enable-weak-ssl-ciphers" will
      not provide any "EXPORT" or "LOW" strength ciphers.

      A double free bug was discovered when OpenSSL parses malformed DSA private keys
      and could lead to a DoS attack or memory corruption for applications that
      receive DSA private keys from untrusted sources.  This scenario is considered
      rare.

      The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had
      confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly
      allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of
      distinguishing these two cases.

      Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid
      login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker
      connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around
      300 bytes per connection.  Servers that do not configure SRP, or
      configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable.

      In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed.

      To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in
      SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if the user has configured
      a seed.  Applications are advised to migrate to
      SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong
      guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid
      logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in
      constant time.

      In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int
      value |i|. Later |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i * 4|. For large values
      of |i| this can result in |bn_expand| not allocating any memory because |i * 4|
      is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a
      subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i * 4|
      could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to
      the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap
      corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This could have security
      consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with
      very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence.

      All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to
      be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If
      user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data
      then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is
      also anticipated to be rare.

      The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" format string in the
      BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string
      and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings.

      Additionally the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB
      memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory
      allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a
      buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing
      a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also occur.

      The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour.
      These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
      passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this
      way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when
      printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that
      print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources.
      OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out
      ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments.

      Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc
      received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to
      trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

      A side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the
      Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of RSA
      keys.  The ability to exploit this issue is limited as it relies on an attacker
      who has control of code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as
      the victim thread which is performing decryptions.

      This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which
      time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293.

      s2_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If
      clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key
      bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an
      eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an
      oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the
      server and negligible computation.

      More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is
      effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant
      computation.

      This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which
      time the code was refactored to address the vulnerability CVE-2015-0293.

      s2_srvr.c overwrite the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying
      Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites.  This provides a
      Bleichenbacher oracle, and could potentially allow more efficient variants of
      the DROWN attack.

    <description>
      Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on "safe"
      primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating
      X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The
      primes used in such files may not be "safe". Where an application is using DH
      configured with parameters based on primes that are not "safe" then an attacker
      could use this fact to find a peer's private DH exponent. This attack requires
      that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same
      private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS server's
      private DH exponent if it's reusing the private DH exponent or it's using a
      static DH ciphersuite.

      OpenSSL provides the option SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS.
      It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the
      same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be
      vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set
      this option and would therefore not be at risk.

      OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if:
      - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh()/SSL_set_tmp_dh() is used and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not
        set.
      - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used, and both the
        parameters and the key are set and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not used. This is
        an undocumted feature and parameter files don't contain the key.
      - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and
        so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2.

      It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if:
      - SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is set
      - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used and the
        callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is
        almost always used like this.

      Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using:
      - genpkey with the dh_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file
        including the prime-order subgroup size "q". This is supported since the 1.0.2
        version. Older versions can't read files generated in this way.
      - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as
        requiring the single use.

      The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a "q" parameter is
      available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the
      only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites.
      This could have some performance impact.

      Additionally the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option has been switched on by default
      and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.

      There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No
      EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA
      as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
      believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
      difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information
      about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources
      required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only
      accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would
      additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
      private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private
      key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by
      default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

      The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference
      if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and absent
      mask generation function parameter. Since these routines are used to verify
      certificate signature algorithms this can be used to crash any certificate
      verification operation and exploited in a DoS attack. Any application which
      performs certificate verification is vulnerable including OpenSSL clients and
      servers which enable client authentication.

      If PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client then
      the values are wrongly updated in the parent SSL_CTX structure. This can
      result in a race condition potentially leading to a double free of the
      identify hint data.

      An error in the implementation of the alternative certificate
      chain logic could allow an attacker to cause certain checks on
      untrusted certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag,
      enabling them to use a valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and
      "issue" an invalid certificate.

      When processing an ECParameters structure OpenSSL enters an infinite loop if
      the curve specified is over a specially malformed binary polynomial field.

      This can be used to perform denial of service against any
      system which processes public keys, certificate requests or
      certificates.  This includes TLS clients and TLS servers with
      client authentication enabled.

    <description>
      X509_cmp_time does not properly check the length of the ASN1_TIME
      string and can read a few bytes out of bounds. In addition,
      X509_cmp_time accepts an arbitrary number of fractional seconds in the
      time string.

      An attacker can use this to craft malformed certificates and CRLs of
      various sizes and potentially cause a segmentation fault, resulting in
      a DoS on applications that verify certificates or CRLs. TLS clients
      that verify CRLs are affected. TLS clients and servers with client
      authentication enabled may be affected if they use custom verification
      callbacks.

      The PKCS#7 parsing code does not handle missing inner EncryptedContent
      correctly. An attacker can craft malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs
      with missing content and trigger a NULL pointer dereference on parsing.

      Applications that decrypt PKCS#7 data or otherwise parse PKCS#7
      structures from untrusted sources are affected. OpenSSL clients and
      servers are not affected.

      When verifying a signedData message the CMS code can enter an infinite loop
      if presented with an unknown hash function OID.

      This can be used to perform denial of service against any system which
      verifies signedData messages using the CMS code.

      This vulnerability does not affect current versions of OpenSSL. It
      existed in previous OpenSSL versions and was fixed in June 2014.

      If a DTLS peer receives application data between the ChangeCipherSpec
      and Finished messages, buffering of such data may cause an invalid
      free, resulting in a segmentation fault or potentially, memory
      corruption.

Multiblock corrupted pointer.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the "multiblock" performance improvement. This feature
only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI
instructions. A defect in the implementation of "multiblock" can cause OpenSSL's
internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking
IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this
will only result in a failed connection. However if some other BIO is used then
it is likely that a segmentation fault will be triggered, thus enabling a
potential DoS attack.

Segmentation fault in DTLSv1_listen. 
A defect in the implementation of DTLSv1_listen means that state is preserved in
the SSL object from one invocation to the next that can lead to a segmentation
fault. Errors processing the initial ClientHello can trigger this scenario. An
example of such an error could be that a DTLS1.0 only client is attempting to
connect to a DTLS1.2 only server.

PKCS#7 NULL pointer dereference.
The PKCS#7 parsing code does not handle missing outer ContentInfo correctly.
An attacker can craft malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs with
missing content and trigger a NULL pointer dereference on parsing.
Applications that verify PKCS#7 signatures, decrypt PKCS#7 data or
otherwise parse PKCS#7 structures from untrusted sources are
affected. OpenSSL clients and servers are not affected.

    <description>
A vulnerability existed in previous versions of OpenSSL related to the
processing of base64 encoded data. Any code path that reads base64 data from an
untrusted source could be affected (such as the PEM processing routines).
Maliciously crafted base 64 data could trigger a segmenation fault or memory
corruption.

Under certain conditions an OpenSSL 1.0.2 client can complete a handshake with
an unseeded PRNG. If the handshake succeeds then the client random that has been used will have
been generated from a PRNG with insufficient entropy and therefore the output
may be predictable.

Use After Free following d2i_ECPrivatekey error.
A malformed EC private key file consumed via the d2i_ECPrivateKey function could
cause a use after free condition. This, in turn, could cause a double
free in several private key parsing functions (such as d2i_PrivateKey
or EVP_PKCS82PKEY) and could lead to a DoS attack or memory corruption
for applications that receive EC private keys from untrusted
sources. This scenario is considered rare.

X509_to_X509_REQ NULL pointer deref.
The function X509_to_X509_REQ will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if
the certificate key is invalid. This function is rarely used in practice.

      A memory leak can occur in the dtls1_buffer_record function under certain
      conditions. In particular this could occur if an attacker sent repeated
      DTLS records with the same sequence number but for the next epoch. The
      memory leak could be exploited by an attacker in a Denial of Service
      attack through memory exhaustion.

      When openssl is built with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL v3 ClientHello is
      received the ssl method would be set to NULL which could later result in

      An OpenSSL server will accept a DH certificate for client authentication
      without the certificate verify message. This effectively allows a client
      to authenticate without the use of a private key. This only affects
      servers which trust a client certificate authority which issues
      certificates containing DH keys: these are extremely rare and hardly ever
      encountered.

    <description>
      OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature
      algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a
      match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned
      portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the
      signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible
      to change the certificate's fingerprint.

      This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not
      affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other
      way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom
      applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g.
      certificate blacklists) may be affected.

    <description>
      Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms,
      including x86_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low probability,
      and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is
      difficult to determine. The following has been determined:

      *) The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is
      very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128
      on affected 64-bit platforms.
      *) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations
      are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built
      without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug
      attacks [1].
      *) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct
      elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve.
      However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such
      points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is
      believed to be unaffected.
      *) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular
      exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No
      exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the
      attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material
      is involved.

      A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
      sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
      to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
      exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. This issue affects OpenSSL
      1.0.1 server implementations for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of
      whether SRTP is used or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that
      have been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined are not affected.

      When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
      integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
      ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
      causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
      tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
      attack.

      OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
      to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
      downgrade.
  
      Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
      downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
      servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
      downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
      support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
      including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).

A flaw in OBJ_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as
X509_name_oneline, X509_name_print_ex, to leak some information from the
stack. Applications may be affected if they echo pretty printing output to the
attacker.  OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers themselves are not affected.

A crash was found affecting SRP ciphersuites used in a Server Hello message.
The issue affects OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious server to crash
the client with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an SRP
ciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated with the client. This 
could lead to a Denial of Service.

A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate
TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message is
badly fragmented. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a
downgrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server and the client support a higher
protocol version, by modifying the client's TLS records.

A flaw in OpenSSL 0.9.6k (only) would cause certain ASN.1 sequences to
trigger a large recursion.  On platforms such as Windows this large
recursion cannot be handled correctly and so the bug causes OpenSSL to
crash.  A remote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can send
arbitrary ASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash.  This
could be performed for example by sending a client certificate to a
SSL/TLS enabled server which is configured to accept them.

The Google Security Team discovered several functions inside OpenSSL
incorrectly checked the result after calling the EVP_VerifyFinal
function, allowing a malformed signature to be treated as a good
signature rather than as an error.  This issue affected the signature
checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.  One way to exploit
this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in control of a
malicious server or who can use a 'man in the middle' attack to
present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a
vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code where an old bug workaround
allows malicious clients to modify the stored session cache
ciphersuite. In some cases the ciphersuite can be downgraded to a
weaker one on subsequent connections.  This issue only affects OpenSSL

and the SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG flag (many
applications enable this by using the SSL_OP_ALL option).

RFC 3779 data can be included in certificates, and if it is malformed,
may trigger an assertion failure. This could be used in a
denial-of-service attack.  Builds of OpenSSL are only vulnerable if configured with 
"enable-rfc3779", which is not a default.

  <description>A flaw in the do_ssl3_write function can allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference.  This flaw
only affects OpenSSL 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 where SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is
enabled, which is not the default and not common.</description>

  <description>A race condition in the ssl3_read_bytes function can allow remote
attackers to inject data across sessions or cause a denial of service.
This flaw only affects multithreaded applications using OpenSSL 1.0.0
and 1.0.1, where SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, which is not the
default and not common.</description>
