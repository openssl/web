            First issued 13th February 2017<br/>

          <p>This document defines the bylaws under which the OpenSSL Project
          operates. It defines the different project roles, how they contribute
          to the project, and how project decisions are made.</p>

          <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

          <h3>Users</h3>

          <p>Users include any individual or organisation that downloads,
          installs, compiles, or uses the OpenSSL command line applications or
          the OpenSSL libraries or the OpenSSL documentation. This includes
          OpenSSL-based derivatives such as patched versions of OpenSSL provided
          through OS distributions, often known as "downstream" versions.</p>

          <p>Users may request help and assistance from the project through any
          appropriate forum as designated by the OpenSSL Management Committee
          (OMC). Users may also report bugs, issues, or feature requests; or
          make pull requests through any OMC designated channel.</p>

          <h3><a name="committers">Committers</a></h3>

          <p>Committers have the ability to make new commits to the main OpenSSL
          Project repository. Collectively, they have the responsibility for
          maintaining the contents of that repository. They must ensure that any
          committed contributions are consistent with all appropriate OpenSSL
          policies and procedures as defined by the OMC.</p>

          <p>Committers also have a responsibility to review code submissions in
          accordance with OpenSSL project policies and procedures.</p>

          <p>Commit access is granted as a result of a vote by the OMC. It may
          be withdrawn at any time by a vote of the OMC.</p>

          <p>A condition of commit access is that the committer has signed an
          Individual Contributor Licence Agreement (ICLA). If contributions may
          also be from the employer of an individual with commit access then a
          Corporate Contributor Licence Agreement (CCLA) must also be signed and
          include the name of the committer.</p>

          <p>In order to retain commit access a committer must have authored or
          reviewed at least one commit within the previous two calendar
          quarters. This will be checked at the beginning of each calendar
          quarter. This rule does not apply if the committer first received
          their commit access during the previous calendar quarter.</p>

          <h3><a name="OMC">OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC)</a></h3>

          <p>The OMC represents the official voice of the project. All official
          OMC decisions are taken on the basis of a vote.</p>

          <p>The OMC:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>makes all decisions regarding management and strategic direction
            of the project;</li>
            <li>sets and maintains all policies and procedures;</li>
            <li>nominates, elects and removes committers and OMC members as
            required;</li>
            <li>ensures security issues are dealt with in an appropriate
            manner;</li>
            <li>schedules releases and determines future release plans and the
            development roadmap and priorities;</li>
            <li>maintains all other repositories according to the policies and
            procedures they define.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Membership of the OMC is by invitation only from the existing OMC
          following a passing vote. OMC members may or may not be committers as
          well. If an OMC member is also a committer then all rules that apply
          to committers still apply.</p>

          <p>The OMC makes decisions on behalf of the project. In order to have
          a valid voice on the OMC, members must be actively contributing to the
          project. Note that there are many ways to contribute to the project
          but the ones that count in order to participate in the OMC
          decision-making process are the ones listed below.</p>

          <p>OMC members may become inactive. In order to remain active a member
          must, in any calendar quarter, contribute by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a) Having authored, or been recorded as a reviewer of, at least
            one commit made to any OpenSSL repository (including non-code based
            ones) and</li>
            <li>b) vote in at least two-thirds of the total votes closed in the
            first two months of the quarter and the last month of the preceding
            quarter.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The above rules will be applied at the beginning of each calender
          quarter. It does not apply if the OMC member was first appointed, or
          became active again during the previous calendar quarter. The voting
          requirement only includes those votes after the time the member joined
          or was made active again.</p>

          <p>If an OMC member remains inactive for one calendar quarter then
          they will no longer be considered an OMC member, but will be listed as
          an OMC Alumni. OMC Alumni have no access to OMC internal resources
          (including email lists) but may request a vote at any time to
          reinstate their membership in the OMC.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member can propose a vote to declare another member
          inactive or remove them from OMC membership entirely.</p>

          <p>An OMC member can declare themselves inactive, leave the OMC, or
          leave the project entirely. This does not require a vote.</p>

          <p>An inactive OMC member can propose a vote that the OMC declare them
          active again. Inactive OMC members cannot vote but can propose issues
          to vote on and participate in discussions. They retain access to OMC
          internal resources.</p>

          <h3>OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF)</h3>

          <p>The OpenSSL Software Foundation represents the OpenSSL project in
          legal and most official formal capacities in relation to external
          entities and individuals. This includes, but is not limited to,
          managing contributor license agreements, managing donations,
          registering and holding trademarks, registering and holding domain
          names, obtaining external legal advice, and so on.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member may serve as a director of OSF if they wish. To do
          so they should send a request to any existing OSF director.</p>

          <h3>OpenSSL Software Services (OSS)</h3>

          <p>OpenSSL Software Services represents the OpenSSL project for most
          commercial and quasi-commercial  contexts, such as providing formal
          support contracts and brokering consulting contracts for OpenSSL
          committers.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member may serve as a director of OSS if they wish, subject
          to certain contractual requirements. To do so they should send a
          request to any existing OSS director.</p>

          <h2>OMC Voting Procedures</h2>

          <p>A vote to change these bylaws will pass if it obtains an in favour
          vote by more than two thirds of the active OMC members and less than
          one quarter votes against by the active OMC members. A vote that does
          not change these bylaws will pass if it has had a vote registered from
          a majority of active OMC members and has had more votes registered in
          favour than votes registered against.</p>

          <p>Only active OMC members may vote. A registered vote is a vote in
          favour, a vote against, or an abstention.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member (active or inactive) can propose a vote. OMC Alumni
          may only propose a vote to reinstate themselves to the OMC. Each vote
          must include a closing date which must be between seven and fourteen
          calendar days after the start of the vote. Votes to change these
          bylaws must be fourteen calendar days in duration.</p>

          <p>In exceptional cases, the closing date for non-bylaw changing votes
          could be less than seven calendar days; for example, a critical issue
          that needs rapid action. A critical issue is hard to define precisely
          but would include cases where a security fix is needed and the details
          will soon be made public. At least one other active OMC member besides
          the proposer needs to agree to the shorter timescale.</p>

          <p>A vote closes on its specified date. In addition, any active OMC
          member can declare a vote closed once the number of uncast votes could
          not affect the outcome. Any active OMC member may change their vote up
          until the vote is closed. No vote already cast can be changed after
          the vote is closed. Votes may continue to be cast and recorded after a
          vote is closed up until fourteen days after the start of the vote.
          These votes will count for the purposes of determining OMC member
          activity, but will otherwise not affect the outcome of the vote.</p>

          <p>All votes and their outcomes should be recorded and available to
          all OMC members.</p>
