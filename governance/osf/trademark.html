	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This policy is derived from the
            <a href="https://www.debian.org/trademark">Debian Trademark Policy</a>,
            with thanks.</p>

            <p>OpenSSL is committed to protect and ensure consistent usage
            of its trademark, logos, and styles and also make it easier for
            every <em>bonafide</em> user to use. As a part of this process,
            the OpenSSL trademark is a registered United States trademark
            of the OpenSSL Software Foundation.  For registration outside the
            United States, we have filed a <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system">Madrid Protocol</a>
            application to extend the protection in the European Union,
            China and Japan.</p>

            <h2>Trademark Policy</h2>

            <p>This policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form,
            collectively referred to as <q>OpenSSL trademarks.</q></p>

            <p>The objective of this trademark policy is:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>to encourage widespread use and adoption of the OpenSSL
              trademarks,</li>
              <li>to clarify proper usage of OpenSSL trademarks by third
              parties,</li>
              <li>to prevent misuse of OpenSSL trademarks that can confuse
              or mislead users
              with respect to OpenSSL or its affiliates.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit
            commercial activity around OpenSSL. We encourage businesses
            to work on OpenSSL while being compliant with this policy.</p>

            <p>Following are the guidelines for the proper use of OpenSSL
            trademarks by publishers and other third parties. Any use of or
            reference to OpenSSL trademarks that is inconsistent with these
            guidelines, or other unauthorized use of or reference to OpenSSL
            trademarks, or use of marks that are confusingly similar to
            OpenSSL trademarks, is prohibited and may violate OpenSSL
            trademark rights.</p>

            <p>Any use of OpenSSL trademarks in a misleading and false manner
            or in a manner that disparages OpenSSL, such as untruthful
            advertising, is always prohibited.</p>

            <h3>When You Can Use the OpenSSL Trademarks Without Asking Permission</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>You can use OpenSSL trademarks to make true factual
              statements about OpenSSL or communicate compatibility with your
              product truthfully.</li>
              <li>Your intended use qualifies as <q>nominative fair use</q> of
              the OpenSSL trademarks, i.e., merely identifying that you are
              talking about OpenSSL in a text, without suggesting sponsorship
              or endorsement.</li>
              <li>You can use OpenSSL trademarks to describe or advertise your
              services or products relating to OpenSSL in a way that is not
              misleading.</li>
              <li>You can use OpenSSL trademarks to describe OpenSSL in
              articles, titles or blog posts.</li>
              <li>You can make t-shirts, desktop wallpapers, caps, or other
              merchandise with OpenSSL trademarks for
              <em>non-commercial usage</em>.</li>
              <li>You can also make merchandise with OpenSSL trademarks for
              <em>commercial usage</em>. In case of commercial usage, we
              recommend that you truthfully advertise to customers which part
              of the selling price, if any, will be donated to the OpenSSL
              project.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>When You Can NEVER Use the OpenSSL Trademarks Without Asking Permission</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>You cannot use OpenSSL trademarks in any way that suggests
              an affiliation with or endorsement by the OpenSSL project or
              community, if the same is not true.</li>
              <li>You cannot use OpenSSL trademarks in a company or
              organization name or as the name of a product or service.</li>
              <li>You cannot use a name that is confusingly similar to OpenSSL
              trademarks.</li>
              <li>You cannot use OpenSSL trademarks in a domain name, with or
              without commercial intent.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Use the OpenSSL Trademarks</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>Use the OpenSSL trademarks in a manner that makes it clear
              that your project is related to the OpenSSL project, but that it
              is not part of OpenSSL, produced by the OpenSSL project, or
              endorsed by the OpenSSL project.</li>
              <li>Acknowledge OpenSSL Software Foundation's ownership of the
              OpenSSL trademark prominently.  For example:<br/><br/>
              <p>[TRADEMARK] is a (<q>registered,</q> if applicable) trademark
              owned by the OpenSSL Software Foundation.</p></li>
              <li>Include a disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or
              endorsement by OpenSSL on your website and on all related
              printed materials. For example:<br/><br/>
              <p>X PROJECT is not affiliated with OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a
              registered trademark owned by OpenSSL Software
              Foundation.</p></li>
              <li>Distinguish the OpenSSL trademarks from the surrounding
              words by italicizing, bolding or underlining it.</li>
              <li>Use the OpenSSL trademarks in their exact form, neither
              abbreviated or hyphenated, nor combined with any other word or
              words.</li>
              <li>Do not create acronyms using the OpenSSL trademarks.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Permission To Use</h3>

            <p>When in doubt about the use of OpenSSL trademarks, or to
            request permission for uses not allowed by this policy, please
            send an email to
            <a href="mailto:contact@openssl.org">contact@openssl.org</a>.

              <li>Name of the organization/project</li>
              <li>Purpose of Use (commercial/non-commercial)</li>
              <li>Nature of Use</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Guidelines for Using Logos</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Any scaling must retain the original proportions of the
              logo.</li>
              <li>Do not use the OpenSSL logos as part of your company logo or
              product logo or branding itself. They can be used as part of a
              page describing your products or services.</li>
              <li>You need not ask us for permission to use logos on your own
              website solely as a hyperlink to the OpenSSL project
              website.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
