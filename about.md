## Anton Arapov
Joining the OpenSSL team in February 2023, I brought along experience from
previous roles in Red Hat. At Red Hat, I had the opportunity to grow from an
engineer to an engineering manager, contributing to the Linux Kernel and later
leading teams in OpenStack and OpenShift projects. Now at OpenSSL, I am
committed to utilising my experience to contribute to our shared mission of
enhancing digital security.

## Dmitry Misharov
I am a DevOps enthusiast with a knack for Python, cloud technologies, and
rigorous testing. My journey through roles at renowned organizations, such as
Red Hat, has sharpened my skills in building robust automation solutions,
containerization, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines. I am passionate about open
source and am proud to be part of the OpenSSL Software Foundation team. With a
strong foundation in Python, a commitment to quality, and a belief in the power
of open collaboration, I am ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

## Hugo Landau
I'm a software and infrastructure engineer with a background in networking,
security and cryptography. An OTC member, I take principal responsibility for
the development of OpenSSL's QUIC functionality. As a strong believer in the
values of open source, I'm proud to be part of the OpenSSL project given its
instrumental role in the security of internet infrastructure.

## Matt Caswell
I have been a full time developer on the OpenSSL Project since 2014 with a
particular focus on libssl. I have been lucky to be involved with the development
of major features in OpenSSL over the years including the implementation of
TLSv1.3, the new provider architecture in 3.0, the new FIPS module and QUIC.
As well as development I am also active in the governance of OpenSSL including
as a member of OpenSSL's management and technical committees.

## Neil Horman
I've been an open source contributor for the last 20 years, focusing on various
projects throughout the ecosystem. My primary focus has been on networking,
cryptography, and various low-level system utilities. I'm currently the
maintainer of the irqbalance and rngd daemons. At various times, I've maintained
the SCTP networking protocol and the cryptographic X9.31 pseudo-random number
generator in the Linux kernel. While I have enjoyably spent most of my career
fixing bugs, I'm looking forward to contributing to large-scale development in
OpenSSL.

## Paul Dale
I worked sporadically with OpenSSL on embedded systems from the early 2000s and
started contributing back to the project in 2016, finally joining the team full
time in 2021 to concentrate on making OpenSSL better than ever. I have a special
interest in entropy and randomness and am a member of the management and
technical committees.

## Richard Levitte
I've been an active FOSS contributor since 1990, with a focus on the
operating system OpenVMS at the time.  Back then, I mainly ported diverse
GNU programs (most of all newer versions of Emacs) to that operating system.
In the late 1990's, I became interested in cryptography, which led me to
SSLeay, and then to the OpenSSL Project, which I became an active member of
in late 1999.  This has been my most consistent FOSS activity ever since.

## Tim Hudson
Co-founded SSLeay in 1996, worked on RSA's "forks" from 1998-2007, joined
old-OSF for OpenSSL commercial activities in 2008-2014, officially joined the
"OpenSSL Project" as a volunteer in 2014. Member of the OMC, OTC, and a
committer. Focused on governance, long term sustainability, business
relationships, practical application of security technologies for the project.

## Tomáš Mráz
I developed and maintained various security and crypto-related software at
Red Hat since 2004. Among other duties including maintaining the OpenSSL
package I worked to ensure that the crypto libraries incorporated into Red Hat
Enterprise Linux were FIPS compliant and validated. After leaving Red Hat in
2021, I was happy to join the OpenSSL project, where I helped finalize the
OpenSSL 3.0 release and get the FIPS provider module validated. Currently, my
primary focus is developing the implementation of the QUIC protocol in OpenSSL
and making sure we respond to issues raised on our github project in a timely
manner.
