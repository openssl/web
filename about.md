## Anton Arapov
Joining the OpenSSL team in February 2023, I brought along experience from
previous roles in Red Hat and Mavenir. At Red Hat, I had the opportunity to
grow from an engineer to an engineering manager, contributing to the Linux
Kernel and later leading teams in OpenStack and OpenShift projects. My journey
then led me to Mavenir, where I applied my skills and knowledge to help align
the company's telecom products and services with the realities of a modern
cloud environment. Now at OpenSSL, I am committed to utilizing my experience
to contribute to our shared mission of enhancing digital security through
reliable encryption solutions.

## Mark J Cox
I am proud to have been one of the original founders of the OpenSSL project
back in 1998. Throughout the years, I have contributed my expertise in security
vulnerability handling, management, and finance. Presently, my primary focus is
on the financial aspects, working to ensure the project's long-term
sustainability and success.

## Matt Caswell
I have been a full time developer on the OpenSSL Project since 2014 with a
particular focus on libssl. I have been lucky to be involved with the development
of major features in OpenSSL over the years including the implementation of
TLSv1.3, the new provider architecture in 3.0, the new FIPS module and QUIC.
As well as development I am also active in the governance of OpenSSL including
as a member of OpenSSL's management and technical committees.

## Tomáš Mráz
I developed and maintained various security and crypto-related software at
Red Hat since 2004. Among other duties including maintaining the OpenSSL
package I worked to ensure that the crypto libraries incorporated into Red Hat
Enterprise Linux were FIPS compliant and validated. After leaving Red Hat in
2021, I was happy to join the OpenSSL project, where I helped finalize the
OpenSSL 3.0 release and get the FIPS provider module validated. Currently, my
primary focus is developing the implementation of the QUIC protocol in OpenSSL
and making sure we respond to issues raised on our github project in a timely
manner.
