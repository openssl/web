# About Us

Welcome to the 'About Us' page. We are a dedicated participant in the global
cybersecurity landscape, contributing our efforts towards the development of
security and privacy tools. Our dedicated team is at the helm of the OpenSSL
project, ensuring secure digital interactions. Here, you'll meet the individuals
who are collectively shaping a safer, privacy-respecting digital future.

## Aleš Mareček
SysOps and DevOps Engineer, Security enthusiast, Quality driven, Bug hunter,
Open source ambassador.
To be honest and responsible are one of the core values I keep. I believe that
meritocracy and transparency are inseparable parts from the way to build a
successful community.
I'm into security since 1998 when my personal OpenBSD server and firewall
started playing zeroes and ones games on Internet. At that time I met OpenSSL
for the first time. During a couple of years I was using and testing OpenSSL
libraries in both work and personal lives. Finally I joined OpenSSL in 2022 to
become a part of the project as Sys/DevOps.

## Anton Arapov
Joining the OpenSSL team in February 2023, I brought along experience from
previous roles in Red Hat and Mavenir. At Red Hat, I had the opportunity to
grow from an engineer to an engineering manager, contributing to the Linux
Kernel and later leading teams in OpenStack and OpenShift projects. My journey
then led me to Mavenir, where I applied my skills and knowledge to help align
the company's telecom products and services with the realities of a modern
cloud environment. Now at OpenSSL, I am committed to utilizing my experience
to contribute to our shared mission of enhancing digital security through
reliable encryption solutions.

## Hugo Landau
I'm a software and infrastructure engineer with a background in networking,
security and cryptography. An OTC member, I take principal responsibility for
the development of OpenSSL's QUIC functionality. As a strong believer in the
values of open source, I'm proud to be part of the OpenSSL project given its
instrumental role in the security of internet infrastructure.

## Kurt Roeckx
To Be Defined =)

## Mark J Cox
I am proud to have been one of the original founders of the OpenSSL project
back in 1998. Throughout the years, I have contributed my expertise in security
vulnerability handling, management, and finance. Presently, my primary focus is
on the financial aspects, working to ensure the project's long-term
sustainability and success.

## Matt Caswell
I have been a full time developer on the OpenSSL Project since 2014 with a
particular focus on libssl. I have been lucky to be involved with the development
of major features in OpenSSL over the years including the implementation of
TLSv1.3, the new provider architecture in 3.0, the new FIPS module and QUIC.
As well as development I am also active in the governance of OpenSSL including
as a member of OpenSSL's management and technical committees.

## Paul Dale
I worked sporadically with OpenSSL on embedded systems from the early 2000s and
started contributing back to the project in 2016, finally joining the team full
time in 2021 to concentrate on making OpenSSL better than ever. I have a special
interest in entropy and randomness and am a member of the management and
technical committees.

## Richard Levitte
To Be Defined =)

## Tam Dale
I joined the project in July 2023, and as the only non-technical contractor,
there’s been quite a learning curve.  My role is to manage our support
contracts, assist our Customers and Sponsors, manage the day to day
operational side of the Project, as well as to develop procedures and policies
that support the Project’s long term goals.

## Tim Hudson
Co-founded SSLeay in 1996, worked on RSA's "forks" from 1998-2007, joined
old-OSF for OpenSSL commercial activities in 2008-2014, officially joined the
"OpenSSL Project" as a volunteer in 2014. Member of the OMC, OTC, and a
committer. Focused on governance, long term sustainability, business
relationships, practical application of security technologies for the project.

## Tomáš Mráz
I developed and maintained various security and crypto-related software at
Red Hat since 2004. Among other duties including maintaining the OpenSSL
package I worked to ensure that the crypto libraries incorporated into Red Hat
Enterprise Linux were FIPS compliant and validated. After leaving Red Hat in
2021, I was happy to join the OpenSSL project, where I helped finalize the
OpenSSL 3.0 release and get the FIPS provider module validated. Currently, my
primary focus is developing the implementation of the QUIC protocol in OpenSSL
and making sure we respond to issues raised on our github project in a timely
manner.
