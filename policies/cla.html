            Every non-trival contribution to be
            covered by a signed
	    Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
	    We have modelled our policy based on the practice of
	    <a href="https://www.apache.org">the Apache Software Foundation</a>.
	    You can see their CLA policy
	    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">here</a>.
	  Our policy is:
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  OpenSSL requires that all non-trivial contributors of ideas, code, or
	  documentation complete, sign, and submit (via postal mail, fax
	  or email) an
	  <a href="openssl_icla.pdf">Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)</a>.
	  The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define
	  the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed
	  to OpenSSL and thereby allow us to defend the project should
	  there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future
	  time.</p>

	  <p>
	  <em>Please make sure that the email
	  address matches the one that you use for the "Author" in your
	  git commits.	List multiple email addresses if necessary.</em>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on OpenSSL, a
	  <a href="openssl_ccla.pdf">Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)</a>
	  is available for contributing intellectual property via
	  the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an
	  employment agreement. Note that a Corporate CLA does not
	  remove the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as 
	  an individual.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  If you have not already done so, please complete and sign a printout of the above
	  ICLA (and CCLA if necessary), then scan and email a pdf file of the Agreement(s) to
	  <a href="mailto:legal@opensslfoundation.org">legal@opensslfoundation.org</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  If you prefer snail mail, send an original signed Agreement to the
	  </p>

	  OpenSSL Software Foundation<br>
	  40 East Main Street<br>
	  Suite 744<br>
	  Newark, DE 19711<br>
	  United States
	  </p>

	  Please read the document(s) carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Your Full name will be published unless you provide an alternative
	  Public name. For example if your full name is Andrew Bernard Charles
	  Dickens, but you wish to be known as Andrew Dickens, please enter
	  the latter as your Public name.  If you do not wish to have your
	  name listed as a contributor, use <em>Anonymous</em>.
	  We reserve the right to reject rude or obscene nick-names.
	  The email address and other contact details are not published.
