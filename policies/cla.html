	    <p>
	    As we described in
	    <a href="/blog/blog/2015/08/01/cla/">a blog post</a>,
	    we will soon require almost every
	    contributor to have a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
	    on file.  We are following the practice of
	    <a href="https://www.apache.org">the Apache Software Foundation</a>.
	    You can see their CLA policy
	    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">here</a>.
	  Or, you can just read the following paragraphs :)
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  OpenSSL desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or
	  documentation complete, sign, and submit (via postal mail, fax
	  or email) an Individual CLA [<a href="openssl_icla.pdf">PDF</a>].
	  The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define
	  the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed
	  to OpenSSL and thereby allow us to defend the project should
	  there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future
	  time.</p>

	  <p>
	  The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so we
	  recommend you use a personal email address in the contact
	  details, rather than a work address. Please make sure that the email
	  address matches the one that you use for the "Author" in your git commits.
	  List multiple email addresses if necessary.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on OpenSSL,
	  a Corporate CLA [<a href="openssl_ccla.pdf">PDF</a>]
	  is available for contributing intellectual property via
	  the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an
	  employment agreement. Note that a Corporate CLA does not
	  cover any individual contributions which are not owned by the
	  corporation signing the CCLA.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Your Full name will be published unless you provide an alternative
	  Public name. For example if your full name is Andrew Bernard Charles
	  Dickens, but you wish to be known as Andrew Dickens, please enter
	  the latter as your Public name.  If you do not wish to have your
	  name listed as a contributor, use <em>Anonymous</em>.
	  We reserve the right to reject rude or obscene nick-names.
	  The email address and other contact details are not published.
