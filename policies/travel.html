          <p>The OpenSSL project may pay travel expenses for OMC members when
          pre-approved by the OMC or when it is an official OMC meeting (as
          determined by vote). Project members may seek to be reimbursed if
          their employer is not covering the expense. The requirements for
          reimbursement are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>An email sent to openssl-omc, including scanned attachments of
              all receipts over 30 Euros.</li>
            <li>Barring exceptional circumstances, for an all-day meeting the
              project will pay for arrival the day before and departure the
              following morning.</li>
            <li>When presenting at a conference, the project will pay the
              expenses for the entire conference provided the attendee agrees
              to act as representative of the project during that time.</li>
            <li>Reasonable lodging and meal expenses during the travel time
              will be covered.</li>
            <li>Barring exceptional circumstances, room service, minibar,
              in-room movies, and other similar amenities are not
              covered.</li>
          </ul>
