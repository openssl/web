# Trademark Policy

#### Last modified 27th October 2017

# Introduction

This policy is derived from the [Debian Trademark
Policy](https://www.debian.org/trademark), with thanks.

OpenSSL is committed to protect and ensure consistent usage of its
trademark, logos, and styles and also make it easier for every
*bonafide* user to use. As a part of this process, the OpenSSL trademark
is a registered United States trademark of the OpenSSL Software
Foundation. For registration outside the United States, we have filed a
[Madrid Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system)
application to extend the protection in the European Union, China and
Japan.

# Trademark Policy

This policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form, collectively
referred to as "OpenSSL trademarks."

The objective of this trademark policy is:

1.  to encourage widespread use and adoption of the OpenSSL trademarks,
2.  to clarify proper usage of OpenSSL trademarks by third parties,
3.  to prevent misuse of OpenSSL trademarks that can confuse or mislead
    users with respect to OpenSSL or its affiliates.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial
activity around OpenSSL. We encourage businesses to work on OpenSSL
while being compliant with this policy.

Following are the guidelines for the proper use of OpenSSL trademarks by
publishers and other third parties. Any use of or reference to OpenSSL
trademarks that is inconsistent with these guidelines, or other
unauthorized use of or reference to OpenSSL trademarks, or use of marks
that are confusingly similar to OpenSSL trademarks, is prohibited and
may violate OpenSSL trademark rights.

Any use of OpenSSL trademarks in a misleading and false manner or in a
manner that disparages OpenSSL, such as untruthful advertising, is
always prohibited.

## When You Can Use the OpenSSL Trademarks Without Asking Permission

1.  You can use OpenSSL trademarks to make true factual statements about
    OpenSSL or communicate compatibility with your product truthfully.
2.  Your intended use qualifies as "nominative fair use" of the OpenSSL
    trademarks, i.e., merely identifying that you are talking about
    OpenSSL in a text, without suggesting sponsorship or endorsement.
3.  You can use OpenSSL trademarks to describe or advertise your
    services or products relating to OpenSSL in a way that is not
    misleading.
4.  You can use OpenSSL trademarks to describe OpenSSL in articles,
    titles or blog posts.
5.  You can make t-shirts, desktop wallpapers, caps, or other
    merchandise with OpenSSL trademarks for *non-commercial usage*.
6.  You can also make merchandise with OpenSSL trademarks for
    *commercial usage*. In case of commercial usage, we recommend that
    you truthfully advertise to customers which part of the selling
    price, if any, will be donated to the OpenSSL project.

## When You Can NEVER Use the OpenSSL Trademarks Without Asking Permission

1.  You cannot use OpenSSL trademarks in any way that suggests an
    affiliation with or endorsement by the OpenSSL project or community,
    if the same is not true.
2.  You cannot use OpenSSL trademarks in a company or organization name
    or as the name of a product or service.
3.  You cannot use a name that is confusingly similar to OpenSSL
    trademarks.
4.  You cannot use OpenSSL trademarks in a domain name, with or without
    commercial intent.

## How to Use the OpenSSL Trademarks

1.  Use the OpenSSL trademarks in a manner that makes it clear that your
    project is related to the OpenSSL project, but that it is not part
    of OpenSSL, produced by the OpenSSL project, or endorsed by the
    OpenSSL project.

2.  Acknowledge OpenSSL Software Foundation's ownership of the OpenSSL
    trademark prominently. For example:

    \[TRADEMARK\] is a ("registered," if applicable) trademark owned by
    the OpenSSL Software Foundation.

3.  Include a disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement by
    OpenSSL on your website and on all related printed materials. For
    example:

    X PROJECT is not affiliated with OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a registered
    trademark owned by OpenSSL Software Foundation.

4.  Distinguish the OpenSSL trademarks from the surrounding words by
    italicizing, bolding or underlining it.

5.  Use the OpenSSL trademarks in their exact form, neither abbreviated
    or hyphenated, nor combined with any other word or words.

6.  Do not create acronyms using the OpenSSL trademarks.

## Permission To Use

When in doubt about the use of OpenSSL trademarks, or to request
permission for uses not allowed by this policy, please send an email to
<osf-contact@openssl.org>. Be sure to include the following information
in the body of your message:

-   Name of the User
-   Name of the organization/project
-   Purpose of Use (commercial/non-commercial)
-   Nature of Use

## Guidelines for Using Logos

-   Any scaling must retain the original proportions of the logo.
-   Do not use the OpenSSL logos as part of your company logo or product
    logo or branding itself. They can be used as part of a page
    describing your products or services.
-   You need not ask us for permission to use logos on your own website
    solely as a hyperlink to the OpenSSL project website.

For any queries with respect to these guidelines, please send an email
to <osf-contact@openssl.org>.
