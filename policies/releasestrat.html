	  <p>
	  As of release 1.0.0 the OpenSSL versioning scheme was improved
	  to better meet developers' and vendors' expectations. Letter
	  releases, such as 1.0.2a, exclusively contain bug and security
	  fixes and no new features. Minor releases that change the
	  last digit, e.g. 1.1.0 vs. 1.1.1, can and are likely to
	  contain new features, but in a way that does not break binary
	  compatibility. This means that an application compiled and
	  dynamically linked with 1.1.0 does not need to be recompiled
	  when the shared library is updated to 1.1.1. It should be
	  noted that some features are transparent to the application
	  such as the maximum negotiated TLS version and cipher suites,
	  performance improvements and so on. There is no need to
	  recompile applications to benefit from these features.</p>

	  <p>With regards to current and future releases the OpenSSL
	  project has adopted the following policy:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Version 1.1.0 will be supported until one year after the release of 1.1.1</li>
	    <li>Version 1.0.2 will be supported until 2019-12-31 (LTS).</li>
            <li>Version 1.0.1 is no longer supported.</li>
	    <li>Version 1.0.0 is no longer supported.</li>
	    <li>Version 0.9.8 is no longer supported.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>We may designate a release as a Long Term Support (LTS)
	  release. LTS releases will be supported for at least five years
	  and we will specify one at least every four years. Non-LTS
	  releases will be supported for at least two years.</p>

	  <p>During the final year
	  of support, we do not commit to anything other than security
	  fixes. Before then, bug and security fixes will be applied
	  as appropriate.</p>

	  <p>The next version of OpenSSL will be 1.1.1. This is currently in
	  development and has a primary focus of implementing TLSv1.3. The
	  RFC for TLSv1.3 has not yet been published by the IETF. OpenSSL 1.1.1
	  will not have its final release until that has happened;
          we want to have at least one beta release after TLS 1.3 is
          officially published as an RFC. The next LTS release will be
          1.1.1.</p>

	  <p>The draft release timetable for 1.1.1 is as follows. This may be
          amended at any time as the need arises.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>13th February 2018, alpha release 1 (pre1)</li>
	    <li>27th February 2018, alpha release 2 (pre2)</li>
	    <li>20th March 2018, beta release 1 (pre3)
              <ul>
	        <li>OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable created (feature freeze)</li>
	        <li>master becomes basis for 1.1.2 or 1.2.0 (TBD)</li>
	      </ul>
	    <li>3rd April 2018, beta release 2 (pre4)</li>
	    <li>17th April 2018, beta release 3 (pre5)</li>
	    <li>1st May 2018, beta release 4 (pre6)</li>
            <li>29th May 2018, beta release 5 (pre7)</li>
            <li>19th June 2018, beta release 6 (pre8)</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>An alpha release means:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Not (necessarily) feature complete</li>
	    <li>Not necessarily all new APIs in place yet</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>A beta release means:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Feature complete/Feature freeze (but may include a non-final implementation of the TLSv1.3 specification)</li>
	    <li>Bug fixes only</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>We have defined the following release criteria for 1.1.1:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>All open github issues/PRs older than 2 weeks at the time of release
	    to be assessed for relevance to 1.1.1. Any flagged with the 1.1.1
	    milestone to be closed (see below)</li>
	    <li>Clean builds in Travis and Appveyor for two days</li>
	    <li>run-checker.sh to be showing as clean 2 days before release</li>
	    <li>No open Coverity issues (not flagged as "False Positive" or "Ignore")</li>
	    <li>TLSv1.3 RFC published</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Valid reasons for closing an issue/PR with a 1.1.1 milestone might be:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>We have just now or sometime in the past fixed the issue</li>
	    <li>Unable to reproduce (following discussion with original reporter if
	    possible)</li>
	    <li>Working as intended</li>
	    <li>Deliberate decision not to fix until a later release (this wouldn't
	    actually close the issue/PR but change the milestone instead)</li>
	    <li>Not enough information and unable to contact reporter</li>
	    <li>etc</li>
	  </ul>
