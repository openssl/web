	  <p>
	    As of release 3.0.0, the OpenSSL versioning scheme is changing
	    to a more contemporary format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    With this format, API/ABI compatibility will be guaranteed
	    for the same MAJOR version number. Previously we guaranteed
	    API/ABI compatibility across the same MAJOR.MINOR combination.
	  </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>MAJOR: API/ABI incompatible changes will increase this number</li>
	    <li>MINOR: API/ABI compatible feature releases will change this</li>
	    <li>PATCH: Bug fix releases will increment this number. We also
            allow backporting of accessor functions in these releases.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    This more closely aligns with the expectations of users who are
	    familiar with semantic versioning.  However, we have not adopted
	    semantic versioning in the strict sense of its rules, because it
	    would mean changing our current LTS policies and practices.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The current 1.1.1 versioning scheme remains unchanged:

	    <blockquote><i>
	      As of release 1.0.0 the OpenSSL versioning scheme was improved
	      to better meet developers' and vendors' expectations. Letter
	      releases, such as 1.0.2a, exclusively contain bug and security
	      fixes and no new features. Releases that change the last digit,
	      e.g. 1.1.0 vs. 1.1.1, can and are likely to
	      contain new features, but in a way that does not break binary
	      compatibility. This means that an application compiled and
	      dynamically linked with 1.1.0 does not need to be recompiled
	      when the shared library is updated to 1.1.1. It should be
	      noted that some features are transparent to the application
	      such as the maximum negotiated TLS version and cipher suites,
	      performance improvements and so on. There is no need to
	      recompile applications to benefit from these features.
	    </i></blockquote>
	  </p>

	  <hr />

	  <p>With regards to current and future releases the OpenSSL
	  project has adopted the following policy:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Version 3.0 will be supported until 2026-09-07 (LTS).</li>
	    <li>Version 1.1.1 will be supported until 2023-09-11 (LTS).</li>
	    <li>Version 1.0.2 is no longer supported. Extended support
	    for 1.0.2 to gain access to security fixes for that version is
	    <a href="/support/contracts.html">available</a>.</li>
	    <li>Versions 1.1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8 are no longer supported.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>We may designate a release as a Long Term Support (LTS)
	  release. LTS releases will be supported for at least five years
	  and we will specify one at least every four years. Non-LTS
	  releases will be supported for at least two years.</p>

	  <p>During the final year
	  of support, we do not commit to anything other than security
	  fixes. Before that, bug and security fixes will be applied
	  as appropriate.</p>

          <p>The addition of new platforms to LTS branches is acceptable so
          long as the required changes consist solely of additions to
          configuration.</p>

	  <hr />

	  <p>
	    Before a major release, we make a number of pre-releases, labeled
	    <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i>.
	  </p>

	  <p>An <i>alpha</i> release means:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Not (necessarily) feature complete</li>
	    <li>Not necessarily all new APIs in place yet</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>A <i>beta</i> release means:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Feature complete/Feature freeze</li>
	    <li>Bug fixes only</li>
	  </ul>
      
	  <p>
	    For any major or minor release, we have defined the following
	    release criteria:
	  </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      All open github issues/PRs older than 2 weeks at the time of
	      release need to be assessed for relevance to the version being
	      released. Any flagged with the a milestone for the version
	      to be released must be closed (see below).
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Clean builds in Travis and Appveyor for two days.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      run-checker.sh succeeds on 2 consecutive days before release.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      No open Coverity issues (not flagged as "False Positive" or
	      "Ignore").
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    Valid reasons for closing an issue/PR with a milestone for the
	    version might be:
	  </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      We have just now or sometime in the past fixed the issue
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Unable to reproduce (following discussion with original reporter
	      if possible)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Working as intended
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Deliberate decision not to fix this issue until a later release (this
	      wouldn't actually close the issue/PR but change the milestone
	      instead)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Not enough information and unable to contact reporter
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <hr />

	  <p>No API or ABI breaking changes are allowed in a minor or patch release.
	  The following stability rules apply to all changes made to code
	  targeted for a major release from version 3.0.0 or later:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>No existing public interface can be modified except where changes
	    are unlikely to break source compatibility or where structures are made
	    opaque.
	    <li>No existing public interface can be removed until its replacement
	    has been in place in an LTS stable release. The original interface must
	    also have been documented as deprecated for at least 5 years. A public
	    interface is any function, structure or macro declared in a public
	    header file.</li>
	    <li>When structures are made opaque, any newly required accessor
	    macros or functions are added in a feature release of the extant LTS
	    release and all supported intermediate successor releases.</li>
	  </ul>
