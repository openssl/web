A summary of the discussion thread so far.  Not surprisingly, it's all about
the whitespace. :)

The descriptions here were written to be understandable stand-alone.  Once we
come to a conclusion, we'll wordsmith them into the coding style.

Do not put a space after sizeof; do use parens:

	sizeof(foo)

When breaking long lines, if there are Boolean conditionals, put them at the
start of the line.  Consider doing this consistently, and don't merge even if
they fit.  Here is a bad example, it should be three lines:

	some_long_condition()
	&& short1() && short2()

Related conditions should be on one line if they fit, else given an extra
level of indent

	some_long_condition()
	    && (short1() || short2())
	    && some_other_flag != 0

If the expression for an if statement does not fit, indent the continuation
lines an extra level (this is not necessary for an else-if)

	if (this_is_true()
		&& !that_is_false()) {
	    code();
	    ...

Try not to break long lines within a function call, but if you have to, indent
the rest of the parameter list to be after the function's opening paren.
If the open paren is "far to the right," however, indent less and try to
avoid a column of text.

Remember a blank line after variable declarations (even local ones).

Treat a single-statement with comment as if it were multi-line and use curly
braces. Note that this could end up having "cascading curly" effects.

	if (test()) {
	    /* already alerted */
	    close();
	}

Arguments inside macro expansions should be parenthesized, except when
using the stringify or concatenation operators (# and ## respectively).
The following examples show examples of this, and proper spacing.

	#define foo(a, b) ((a) * (b))
	#define quote(a) #a
	#define join(a, b) a ## quote(a)

Free routines should properly handle null; don't check for null before calling
a free routine.

Argument names in function definition should match the declaration, but you
can use "unused_" as a prefix in the definition for unused arguments.

When possible, use size_t for sizes of things (including array indicies)

Prefer ossl_assert over assert. Do not use OPENSSL_assert() in libcrypto or
libssl.

[ Matt said "initialize in the declaration if appropriate; can someone provide wording? ]

This is controversial, so maybe drop it.  Don't use else after return or goto
unless it makes the flow more clear.
