# Policies

In this section we try to document as many of our policies and
procedures as possible. We do this for two reasons:

-   First, we want to to make sure everyone knows how the project is run.
    For example, when we announce a forthcoming fix for a high-severity bug,
    the [Security Policy](general/security-policy.html) explains what that
    means.
-   Second, it helps us be consistent.
    For example, the [Release Strategy](releasestrat.html) defines the plan
    of record of when, and how long, various releases will be supported.

By being as transparent as possible, we hope to reduce the chance that
people are surprised by what we do, and we hope to help maintain
predictable behavior within the project. This includes how spend some
money, as detailed in the [travel reimbursement policy](travel.html).

If you want to contribute code or fixes to the project, please read the
[Coding Style](technical/coding-style.html) page. For legal obligations
of contributors, see the page on [Contributor Agreements](cla.html). If
you want to become a committer, make sure to also read our
[Guidelines for Committers](general/committer-policy.html).

The OpenSSL project is managed by the OpenSSL Management Committee
(OMC), as defined by the [project bylaws](omc-bylaws.html). It is
represented in most legal and formal capacities by the OpenSSL Software
Foundation, a Delaware (US) non-profit corporation which has its own
[bylaws](osf-bylaws.pdf) as a legal document. Signing one of our CLA's
grants certain rights to OSF.

In addition, the OMC establishes and maintains the [general policies](general/),
and a [general glossary](glossary.html) of terms and what we mean with them.

The technical aspects of the OpenSSL project are managed by the OpenSSL
Technical Committee (OTC) which establishes and maintains the [technical
policies](technical/) based on the project bylaws and the requirements
specified by the OMC.

We are pleased to mention that
[we follow](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/54)
the [best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org) of the
Core Infrastructure Initiative.
