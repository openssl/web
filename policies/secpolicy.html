	    <h2>Introduction</h2>

	    <p>Recent flaws have captured the attention of the media
	    and highlighted how much of the internet infrastructure is
	    based on OpenSSL.  We've never published our policy on how
	    we internally handle security issues; that process being
	    based on experience and has evolved over the years.</p>

	    <h2>Reporting security issues</h2>

	    <p>
	    We have an email address which can be used to notify
	    us of possible security vulnerabilities.  A subset of
	    OpenSSL team members receive this mail, and messages
	    can be sent using PGP encryption.  Full details are at <a
	    href="/news/vulnerabilities.html">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html</a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    When we are notified about an issue we engage resources
	    within the OpenSSL team to investigate and prioritise it.
	    We may also utilise resources from the employers of our team
	    members, as well as others we have worked with before.
	    </p>

	    <h2>Background</h2>

	    <p>
	    Everyone would like to get advance notice of security issues
	    in OpenSSL.  This is a complex topic and we need to set out
	    some background with our findings:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>The more people you tell in advance the higher the
	      likelihood that a leak will occur.  We have seen this
	      happen before, both with OpenSSL and other projects.</li>

	      <li>A huge number of products from an equally large number of
	      organisations use OpenSSL. It's not just secure websites, you're
	      just as likely to find OpenSSL inside your smart TV, car, or
	      fridge.</li>

	      <li>We strongly believe that the right to advance patches/info
	      should not be based in any way on paid membership to some forum.
	      You can not pay us to get security patches in advance.</li>

	      <li>We can benefit from peer review of the patches and advisory.
	      Keeping security issues private means they can't get the level
	      of testing or scrutiny that they otherwise would.</li>

	      <li>It is not acceptable for organisations to use advance notice
	      in marketing as a competitive advantage.  For example "if you
	      had bought our product/used our service you would have been
	      protected a week ago".</li>

	      <li>There are actually not a large number of serious
	      vulnerabilities in OpenSSL which make it worth spending
	      significant time keeping our own list of vendors we trust, or
	      signing framework agreements, or dealing with changes, and
	      policing the policy.  This is a significant amount of effort per
	      issue that is better spent on other things.</li>

	      <li>We have previously used third parties to handle notification
	      for us including CPNI, oCERT, or CERT/CC, but none were
	      suitable.</li>

	      <li>It's in the best interests of the Internet as a whole to get
	      fixes for OpenSSL security issues out quickly. OpenSSL embargoes
	      should be measured in days and weeks, not months or years.</li>

	      <li>Many sites affected by OpenSSL issues will be running a
	      version of OpenSSL they got from some vendor (and likely bundled
	      with an operating system).  The most effective way for these
	      sites to get protected is to get an updated version from that
	      vendor.  Sites who use their own OpenSSL compilations should be
	      able to handle a quick patch and recompile once the issue is
	      public.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Internal handling of security issues</h2>

	    <p>This leads us to our policy for security issues notified
	    to us or found by our team which are not yet public.</p>

	    <p>"private" means kept within the OpenSSL development
	    team.</p>

	    <p>We will determine the risk of each issue being addressed.
	    We will take into account our experience dealing with past
	    issues, versions affected, common defaults, and use cases.
	    We divide the issues into the following categories:</p>

	    <ul>
              <li><em>CRITICAL Severity.</em>
              This affects common configurations and which are also likely to
              be exploitable. Examples include significant disclosure of the
              contents of server memory (potentially revealing user details),
              vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to
              compromise server private keys (excluding local, theoretical or
              difficult to exploit side channel attacks) or where remote code
              execution is considered likely in common situations.  These
              issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of
              all supported versions.  We will attempt to address these as
              soon as possible.</li>

	      <li>
              <em>HIGH Severity.</em>
              This includes issues that are of a lower risk than critical,
              perhaps due to affecting less common configurations, or which
              are less likely to be exploitable.  These issues will be kept
              private and will trigger a new release of all supported
              versions.  We will attempt to keep the time these issues are
              private to a minimum; our aim would be no longer than a month
              where this is something under our control</li>
              
	      <li>
	      <em>MODERATE Severity.</em>
	      This includes issues like crashes in client applications,
	      flaws in protocols that are less commonly used (such as DTLS),
	      and local flaws.  These will in general be kept private until
	      the next release, and that release will be scheduled so that it
	      can roll up several such flaws at one time.</li>
              
	      <li>
	      <em>LOW Severity.</em>
	      This includes issues such as those that only affect the
	      openssl command line utility, unlikely configurations, or hard
	      to exploit timing (side channel) attacks.  These will in general
	      be fixed immediately in latest development versions, and may be
	      backported to older versions that are still getting updates.  We
	      will update the vulnerabilities page and note the issue CVE in
	      the changelog and commit message, but they may not trigger new
	      releases.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>During the investigation of issues we may work with individuals
	    and organisations who are not on the development team.  We do this
	    because past experience has shown that they can add value to our
	    understanding of the issue and the ability to test patches.  In
	    cases where protocols are affected this is the best way to
	    mitigate the risk that a poorly reviewed update causes significant
	    breakage, or to detect if issues are being exploited in the wild.
	    We have a strict policy on what these organisations and
	    individuals can do with the information and will review the need
	    on a case by case basis.</p>

	    <h2>Prenotification policy</h2>

	    <p>Where we are planning an update that fixes security issues
	    we will notify the openssl-announce list and update the home
	    page to give our scheduled update release date and time and
	    the severity of issues being fixed by the update.  No further
	    information about the issues will be given.  This is to aid
	    organisations that need to ensure they have staff available
	    to handle triaging our announcement and what it means to
	    their organisation.</p>

	    <p>For updates that include critical or high severity issues we will
	    also prenotify with more details and patches.  Our policy
	    is to let the organisations that have a general purpose OS
	    that uses OpenSSL have a few days notice in order to prepare
	    packages for their users and feedback test results.</p>

	    <p>We use the mailing list described at <a
	    href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros</a>
	    for this.  We may also include other organisations that
	    would otherwise qualify for list membership.  We may
	    withdraw notifying individual organisations from future
	    prenotifications if they leak issues before they are public
	    or over time do not add value (value can be added by providing
	    feedback, corrections, test results, etc.)</p>

	    <p>Finally, note that not all security issues are notified to
	    us directly; some come from third parties such as companies
	    that pay for vulnerabilities, some come from country CERTs.
	    These intermediaries, or the researchers themselves, may
	    follow a different style of notification. This is within their
	    rights and outside of the control of the OpenSSL team.</p>
