	    <h2>Reporting security issues</h2>

	    <p>
            If you wish to report a possible security issue in OpenSSL
            please <a href="/community/#securityreports">notify us</a>.  
	    </p>

            <h2>Issue triage</h2>
            
	    <p>
            Notifications are received by a group of OpenSSL Management Committee
            members.  We engage resources within
	    OpenSSL to start the investigation and prioritisation.  We may work in private
	    with individuals who are not on the OpenSSL Management Committee as
	    well as other organisations and
	    our <a href="/community/thanks.html">employers</a> where we believe
	    this can help with the issue investigation, resolution, or
	    testing.</p>

	    </p>

	    <h2>Threat Model</h2>

            <p>Certain threats are currently considered outside of the scope of the OpenSSL threat model.
              Accordingly, we do not consider OpenSSL secure against the following classes of attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>local side channel</li>
                <li>same-VM side channel</li>
                <li>same-physical system side channel</li>
                <li>CPU flaws</li>
                <li>physical fault injection</li>
                <li>power consumption observations</li>
              </ul>

             <p>Mitigations for security issues outside of our threat scope may
               still be addressed, however we do not class these as OpenSSL vulnerabilities
               and will therefore not issue CVEs for any mitigations to address these issues.</p>

             <p>Prior to the threat model being included in this policy, CVEs
               were sometimes issued for these classes of attacks. The
               existence of a previous CVE does not override this policy going
               forward.</p>

	    <h2>Issue severity</h2>

	    <p>We will determine the risk of each issue,
	    taking into account our experience dealing with past
	    issues, versions affected, common defaults, and use cases.
            We use the following severity categories:</p>

	    <ul>
              <li><em><a name="critical">CRITICAL</a> Severity.</em>
              This affects common configurations and which are also likely to
              be exploitable. Examples include significant disclosure of the
              contents of server memory (potentially revealing user details),
              vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to
              compromise server private keys 
              or where remote code
              execution is considered likely in common situations.  These
              issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of
              all supported versions.  We will attempt to address these as
              soon as possible.</li>

	      <li>
              <em><a name="high">HIGH</a> Severity.</em>
              This includes issues that are of a lower risk than critical,
              perhaps due to affecting less common configurations, or which
              are less likely to be exploitable.  These issues will be kept
              private and will trigger a new release of all supported
              versions.  We will attempt to keep the time these issues are
              private to a minimum; our aim would be no longer than a month
              where this is something under our control</li>
              
	      <li>
	      <em><a name="moderate">MODERATE</a> Severity.</em>
	      This includes issues like crashes in client applications,
	      flaws in protocols that are less commonly used (such as DTLS),
	      and local flaws.  These will in general be kept private until
	      the next release, and that release will be scheduled so that it
	      can roll up several such flaws at one time.</li>
              
	      <li>
	      <em><a name="low">LOW</a> Severity.</em>
	      This includes issues such as those that only affect the
	      openssl command line utility, or unlikely configurations
	      These will in general
	      be fixed immediately in latest development versions, and may be
	      backported to older versions that are still getting updates.  We
	      will update the vulnerabilities page and note the issue CVE in
	      the changelog and commit message, but they may not trigger new
	      releases.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Prenotification policy</h2>

	    <ul><li>Where we are planning an update that fixes security issues
	    we will notify the <a href="https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-announce">openssl-announce list</a> and update the OpenSSL
	    website to give our scheduled update release date and time and
	    the severity of issues being fixed by the update.  No further
	    information about the issues will be given.</li>

	    <li>Where we are planning an update that include CRITICAL or HIGH severity issues we will
	    also prenotify certain organisations with more details and
	    patches. <ul>
            <li>The organisations we prenotify include those that produce a
	    general purpose OS
	    that uses OpenSSL as included on
	    <a
	    href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">this list of Operating System distribution security contacts</a>.</li>
	    <li>We may also include other organisations that are not listed but
	    would otherwise qualify for list membership.  </li>
            <li>We may
	    withdraw notifying certain organisations from future
	    prenotifications if they leak issues before they are public
	    or over time do not add value. </li></ul></li></ul>

	    <p>Note: researchers or intermediaries who
            notify us of issues may have their own prenotification policy in addition
            to ours.</p>

	    <h2>Principles</h2>

            <p>The policy above is guided by our security principles:</p>
            
	    <ul>
	      <li>It's in the best interests of the Internet as a whole to get
	      fixes for OpenSSL security issues out quickly. OpenSSL embargoes
	      should be measured in days and weeks, not months or years.</li>

	      <li>Many sites affected by OpenSSL issues will be running a
	      version of OpenSSL they got from some vendor (and likely bundled
	      with an operating system).  The most effective way for these
	      sites to get protected is to get an updated version from that
	        vendor.</li>

	    </ul>
