        <div class="entry-content">

          <p>This document defines the bylaws under which the OpenSSL Project
          operates. It defines the different project roles, how they contribute
          to the project, and how project decisions are made.</p>

          <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

          <h3>Users</h3>

          <p>Users include any individual or organisation that downloads,
          installs, compiles, or uses the OpenSSL command line applications or
          the OpenSSL libraries or the OpenSSL documentation. This includes
          OpenSSL-based derivatives such as patched versions of OpenSSL provided
          through OS distributions, often known as "downstream" versions.</p>

          <p>Users may request help and assistance from the project through any
          appropriate forum as designated by the OpenSSL Management Committee
          (OMC). Users may also report bugs, issues, or feature requests; or
          make pull requests through any OMC designated channel.</p>

          <h3><a name="committers">Committers</a></h3>

          <p>Committers have the ability to make new commits to the main OpenSSL
          Project repository. Collectively, they have the responsibility for
          maintaining the contents of that repository. They must ensure that any
          committed contributions are consistent with all appropriate OpenSSL
          policies and procedures as defined by the OMC.</p>

          <p>Committers also have a responsibility to review code submissions in
          accordance with OpenSSL project policies and procedures.</p>

          <p>Commit access is granted by invitation from the OTC and requires
          a prior OMC vote of acceptance. It may be withdrawn at any time by
          a vote of the OMC.</p>

          <p>A condition of commit access is that the committer has signed an
          Individual Contributor Licence Agreement (ICLA). If contributions may
          also be from the employer of an individual with commit access then a
          Corporate Contributor Licence Agreement (CCLA) must also be signed and
          include the name of the committer.</p>

          <p>In order to retain commit access a committer must have authored or
          reviewed at least one commit within the previous two calendar
          quarters. This will be checked at the beginning of each calendar
          quarter. This rule does not apply if the committer first received
          their commit access during the previous calendar quarter.</p>

          <h3><a name="OMC">OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC)</a></h3>

          <p>The OMC represents the official voice of the project. All official
          OMC decisions are taken on the basis of a vote.</p>

          <p>The OMC:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>makes all decisions regarding management and strategic direction
            of the project; including:
            <ul>
              <li>business requirements;</li>
              <li>feature requirements;</li>
              <li>platform requirements;</li>
              <li>roadmap requirements and priority;</li>
              <li>end-of-life decisions;</li>
              <li>release timing and requirement decisions;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>maintains the project infrastructure;</li>
            <li>maintains the project website;</li>
            <li>maintains the project code of conduct;</li>
            <li>sets and maintains all project Bylaws;</li>
            <li>sets and maintains all non-technical policies and non-technical procedures;</li>
            <li>nominates and elects OMC members as required;</li>
            <li>approves or rejects OTC nominations for committers and OTC members;</li>
            <li>adds or removes OMC, OTC, or committers as required;</li>
            <li>adjudicates any objections to OTC decisions;</li>
            <li>adjudicates any objections to any commits to project repositories;</li>
            <li>ensures security issues are dealt with in an appropriate
            manner;</li>
            <li>schedules releases and determines future release plans and the
            development roadmap and priorities;</li>
            <li>maintains all other repositories according to the policies and
            procedures they define.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Membership of the OMC is by invitation only from the existing OMC
          following a passing vote. OMC members may or may not be committers as
          well. If an OMC member is also a committer then all rules that apply
          to committers still apply.</p>

          <p>The OMC makes decisions on behalf of the project. In order to have
          a valid voice on the OMC, members must be actively contributing to the
          project. Note that there are many ways to contribute to the project
          but the ones that count in order to participate in the OMC
          decision-making process are the ones listed below.</p>

          <p>In general, the OMC will leave technical decisions to the OpenSSL
          Technical Committee (OTC, see below) and not participate in
          discussions related to development and documention of the OpenSSL
          Toolkit. In exceptional cases however an OTC vote can be overruled
          by an OMC vote. Such an exceptional case would be for example if an
          OTC decision stands contrary to OMC policies or decisions.</p>

          <p>OMC members may become inactive. In order to remain active a member
          must, in any calendar quarter, contribute by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a) Having authored, or been recorded as a reviewer of, at least
            one commit made to any OpenSSL repository (including non-code based
            ones) and</li>
            <li>b) vote in at least two-thirds of the OMC votes closed in the
            first two months of the quarter and the last month of the preceding
            quarter.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The above rules will be applied at the beginning of each calender
          quarter. It does not apply if the OMC member was first appointed, or
          became active again during the previous calendar quarter. The voting
          requirement only includes those votes after the time the member joined
          or was made active again.</p>

          <p>If an OMC member remains inactive for one calendar quarter then
          they will no longer be considered an OMC member, but will be listed as
          an OMC Alumni. OMC Alumni have no access to OMC internal resources
          (including email lists) but may request a vote at any time to
          reinstate their membership in the OMC.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member can propose a vote to declare another member
          inactive or remove them from OMC membership entirely.</p>

          <p>An OMC member can declare themselves inactive, leave the OMC, or
          leave the project entirely. This does not require a vote.</p>

          <p>An inactive OMC member can propose a vote that the OMC declare them
          active again. Inactive OMC members cannot vote but can propose issues
          to vote on and participate in discussions. They retain access to OMC
          internal resources.</p>

          <h4><a name="omc-voting">OMC Voting Procedures</a></h4>

          <p>A vote to change these bylaws will pass if it obtains an in favour
          vote by more than two thirds of the active OMC members and less than
          one quarter votes against by the active OMC members. A vote that does
          not change these bylaws will pass if it has had a vote registered from
          a majority of active OMC members and has had more votes registered in
          favour than votes registered against.</p>

          <p>Only active OMC members may vote. A registered vote is a vote in
          favour, a vote against, or an abstention.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member (active or inactive) can propose a vote. OMC Alumni
          may only propose a vote to reinstate themselves to the OMC. Each vote
          must include a closing date which must be between seven and fourteen
          calendar days after the start of the vote. Votes to change these
          bylaws must be fourteen calendar days in duration.</p>

          <p>In exceptional cases, the closing date for non-bylaw changing votes
          could be less than seven calendar days; for example, a critical issue
          that needs rapid action. A critical issue is hard to define precisely
          but would include cases where a security fix is needed and the details
          will soon be made public. At least one other active OMC member besides
          the proposer needs to agree to the shorter timescale.</p>

          <p>A vote closes on its specified date. In addition, any active OMC
          member can declare a vote closed once the number of uncast votes could
          not affect the outcome. Any active OMC member may change their vote up
          until the vote is closed. No vote already cast can be changed after
          the vote is closed. Votes may continue to be cast and recorded after a
          vote is closed up until fourteen days after the start of the vote.
          These votes will count for the purposes of determining OMC member
          activity, but will otherwise not affect the outcome of the vote.</p>

          <p>All votes and their outcomes should be recorded and available to
          all OMC members.</p>

          <h3><a name="OTC">OpenSSL Technical Committee (OTC)</a></h3>

          <p>The OTC represents the official technical voice of the project. All
          OTC decisions are taken on the basis of a vote.</p>

          <p>The OTC:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>makes all technical decisions of the code and documentation for OpenSSL including:
            <ul>
              <li>design;</li>
              <li>architecture;</li>
              <li>implementation;</li>
              <li>testing;</li>
              <li>documentation;</li>
              <li>code review;</li>
              <li>quality assurance;</li>
              <li>classification of security issues in accordance with the security policy;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>produces releases according to OMC requirements;</li>
            <li>establishes and maintains technical policies and technical procedures such as:
              <ul>
                <li>GitHub labels and milestone usage;</li>
                <li>coding style;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>nominates to the OMC, addition or removal of OTC members and committers;</li>
            <li>ensures technical aspects of security issues are dealt with in an appropriate
            manner;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Membership of the OTC is by invitation from the OTC and requires
          a prior OMC vote of acceptance. OTC members must be committers and
          hence all rules that apply to committers also apply.
          OTC members may be OMC members and in which case all rules that apply
          to OMC members also apply.</p>

          <p>The OTC makes technical decisions on behalf of the project based on
          requirements specified by the OMC. In order to have
          a valid voice on the OTC, members must be actively contributing to the
          technical aspects of the project. Note that there are many ways to contribute to the project
          but the ones that count in order to participate in the OTC
          decision-making process are the ones listed below.</p>

          <p>OTC members may become inactive. In order to remain active a member
          must, in any calendar quarter, contribute by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a) Having authored, or been recorded as a reviewer of, at least
            one commit made to any OpenSSL repository (including non-code based
            ones) and</li>
            <li>b) vote in at least two-thirds of the OTC votes closed in the
            first two months of the quarter and the last month of the preceding
            quarter and </li>
            <li>c) maintain committer status.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The above rules will be applied at the beginning of each calender
          quarter. It does not apply if the OTC member was first appointed, or
          became active again during the previous calendar quarter. The voting
          requirement only includes those votes after the time the member joined
          or was made active again.</p>

          <p>If an OTC member remains inactive for one calendar quarter then
          they will no longer be considered an OTC member.</p>

          <p>An OTC member can declare themselves inactive, leave the OTC, or
          leave the project entirely. This does not require a vote.</p>

          <p>An inactive OTC member can propose a vote that the OTC declare them
          active again. Inactive OTC members cannot vote but can propose issues
          to vote on and participate in discussions. They retain access to OTC
          internal resources.</p>

          <h4><a name="otc-voting">OTC Voting Procedures</a></h4>

          <p>A vote will pass if it has had a vote registered from
          a majority of active OTC members and has had more votes registered in
          favour than votes registered against.</p>

          <p>Only active OTC members may vote. A registered vote is a vote in
          favour, a vote against, or an abstention.</p>

          <p>Any OTC member (active or inactive) can propose a vote.
          Each vote must include a closing date which must be between seven and fourteen
          calendar days after the start of the vote. </p>

          <p>In exceptional cases, the closing date
          could be less than seven calendar days; for example, a critical issue
          that needs rapid action. A critical issue is hard to define precisely
          but would include cases where a security fix is needed and the details
          will soon be made public. At least one other active OTC member besides
          the proposer needs to agree to the shorter timescale.</p>

          <p>A vote closes on its specified date. In addition, any active OTC
          member can declare a vote closed once the number of uncast votes could
          not affect the outcome. Any active OTC member may change their vote up
          until the vote is closed. No vote already cast can be changed after
          the vote is closed. Votes may continue to be cast and recorded after a
          vote is closed up until fourteen days after the start of the vote.
          These votes will count for the purposes of determining OTC member
          activity, but will otherwise not affect the outcome of the vote.</p>

          <p>All votes and their outcomes should be recorded and available to
          all OTC and OMC members.</p>

          <h4><a name="otc-transparency">OTC Transparency</a></h4>
          <p>
          The majority of the activity of the OTC will take place in public.
          Non-public discussions or votes shall only occur for issues such as:
          <ul>
            <li>pre-disclosure security problems</li>
            <li>pre-agreement discussions with third parties that require confidentiality</li>
            <li>nominees for OTC or committer roles</li>
            <li>personal conflicts among project personnel</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>Full details (topic, dates, voting members, specific votes cast, vote result) of
          all public votes shall be made available in a public repository.</p>

          <h3>OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF)</h3>

          <p>The OpenSSL Software Foundation represents the OpenSSL project in
          legal and most official formal capacities in relation to external
          entities and individuals. This includes, but is not limited to,
          managing contributor license agreements, managing donations,
          registering and holding trademarks, registering and holding domain
          names, obtaining external legal advice, and so on.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member may serve as a director of OSF if they wish. To do
          so they should send a request to any existing OSF director.</p>

          <h3>OpenSSL Software Services (OSS)</h3>

          <p>OpenSSL Software Services represents the OpenSSL project for most
          commercial and quasi-commercial  contexts, such as providing formal
          support contracts and brokering consulting contracts for OpenSSL
          committers.</p>

          <p>Any OMC member may serve as a director of OSS if they wish, subject
          to certain contractual requirements. To do so they should send a
          request to any existing OSS director.</p>


          <h2><a name="leave">Leave of absence</a></h2>

          <p>An active OMC member, OTC member, or committer may request a leave of absence
          from the project. A leave of absence from the OMC, OTC or committer shall
          suspend inactivity determination for the specified role. All access to
          OMC, OTC or committer resources shall be suspended (disabled) and the OMC
          or OTC member shall be excluded from voting and the committer shall be excluded
          from reviewing or approving source changes. On return from a leave of
          absence, the OMC or OTC member or committer will be deemed to have become active
          as of the date of return.</p>

          <p>All of the following criteria must be met in order to qualify as a
          leave of absence:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a) the member must request via email to the OMC a leave of
                   absence at least one week in advance of the requested
                   period of leave;</li>
            <li>b) only one leave of absence is permitted per calendar year;</li>
            <li>c) the leave of absence must specify the date of return from
                   the leave of absence; </li>
            <li>d) the length of the leave of absence shall be a minimum of one calendar
                   month and shall not exceed three calendar months (one quarter); and </li>
            <li>e) the leave of absence applies to all the roles within the
                   project (i.e. OMC, OTC and committer if all three roles apply).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><a name="update">Bylaws Update History</a></h2>
          <p>
          The following changes have been made since the bylaws were first
          issued 13-February-2017.
