# Contributor Agreements

Every non-trivial contribution needs to be covered by a signed
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) from all original authors. We have
modelled our policy based on the practice of [the Apache Software
Foundation](https://www.apache.org). You can see their CLA policy
[here](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas). Our policy is:

OpenSSL requires that all non-trivial contributors of ideas, code, or
documentation complete, sign, and submit (via postal mail, fax or email)
an [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](openssl_icla.pdf).
The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which
intellectual property has been contributed to OpenSSL and thereby allow
us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the
software at some future time.

A submission is trivial if it is considered trivial under copyright law.
Since we are not lawyers, we place the bar for trivial contributions
very high. For example: corrections of grammatical or typographical
errors (including misspelled function names in manual pages), simple
whitespace changes and in some cases one-line bugfixes might be accepted
as trivial without requiring a CLA.

In practice, it is required that the author (in the git commit message)
and all approving team members (in the pull request thread) agree that a
change is trivial. The author has to add "CLA: trivial" in the commit
message separated by an empty line from the rest of the message. The
reviewers will normally post a statement to the effect of "I agree that
it is a trivial change."

*When filling in the CLA, please make sure that the email address
matches the one that you use for the "Author" in your git commits.
List multiple email addresses if necessary.*

For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on OpenSSL, a
[Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](openssl_ccla.pdf) is
available for contributing intellectual property via the corporation,
that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement. Note
that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to
sign their own ICLA as an individual.

If you have not already done so, please complete and sign a printout of
the above ICLA (and CCLA if necessary), then scan and email a pdf file
of the Agreement(s) to <legal@opensslfoundation.org>.

If you prefer snail mail, send an original signed Agreement to the

OpenSSL Software Foundation\
40 East Main Street\
Suite 744\
Newark, DE 19711\
United States

Please read the document(s) carefully before signing and keep a copy for
your records.

Your Full name will be published unless you provide an alternative
Public name. For example if your full name is Andrew Bernard Charles
Dickens, but you wish to be known as Andrew Dickens, please enter the
latter as your Public name. If you do not wish to have your name listed
as a contributor, use *Anonymous*. We reserve the right to reject rude
or obscene nick-names. The email address and other contact details are
not published.
