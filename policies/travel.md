# Travel Reimbursement Policy

#### First issued 28th February 2018 

The OpenSSL project may pay travel expenses for OMC members when
pre-approved by the OMC or when it is an official OMC meeting (as
determined by vote). Project members may seek to be reimbursed if their
employer is not covering the expense. The requirements for reimbursement
are:

-   An email sent to openssl-omc, including scanned attachments of all
    receipts over 30 Euros.
-   Barring exceptional circumstances, for an all-day meeting the
    project will pay for arrival the day before and departure the
    following morning.
-   When presenting at a conference, the project will pay the expenses
    for the entire conference provided the attendee agrees to act as
    representative of the project during that time.
-   Reasonable lodging and meal expenses during the travel time will be
    covered.
-   Barring exceptional circumstances, room service, minibar, in-room
    movies, and other similar amenities are not covered.
