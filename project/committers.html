              <h2>Who is a committer?</h2>

              <p>OpenSSL committers are contributors who have commit access
              to the
              <a href="https://git.openssl.org">OpenSSL source code repository</a>.
              Committers review and commit their own patches as well as
              those of other contributors.</p>

              <h2>How to become a committer?</h2>
              <p>Commit access is granted by the OpenSSL Management Committee
              (OMC) (see the
              <a href="/governance/om/bylaws.html">OpenSSL bylaws</a>).

              <p>We welcome contributors who become domain experts in some
              part of the library (for example, low-level crypto) as well as
              generalists who contribute to all areas of the codebase. All
              committers share the responsibility for the overall health
              of the project: aside from contributing quality features,
              committers are team players who fix bugs, address open
              issues, review community contributions, and improve tests and
              documentation. Committers are also shepherds of the OpenSSL
              community and its
              <a href="/community/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.</p>

              <p>To become a committer, start by contributing code. Read our
              <a href="/project/codingstyle.html">coding style</a>, and get
              to know our build and test system. Then, use the
              <a href="/project/roadmap.html">project roadmap</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues">Github issue tracker</a>,
              and our
              <a href="/community/mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>
              find impactful ideas to work on. Seek feedback from multiple OMC
              members to understand the project, and to support your
              application. Let them know that you'd like to become a committer
              - they'll nominate you when your code review record demonstrates
              impact as well as understanding of the codebase and coding style
              (usually after a few months of activity). The final decision to
              grant commit access is taken by an OMC vote.</p>

              <h2>How to maintain commit status?</h2>
              <p>To maintain commit status, you should stay active in the
              project. As stated in the project bylaws, if you remain inactive
              for several months, your commit access will be withdrawn - but
              you are always welcome back, just ask an OMC member to
              re-nominate you.</p>
              <p>In the unlikely and unfortunate event that your actions
              conflict with the project objectives or are otherwise
              disruptive, commit access may also be revoked by vote of the
              OMC.</p>

              <h2>Code reviews</h2>
              <p>All submissions must be reviewed and approved by at least two
              committers, one of whom must also be an OMC member. If the
              author is also a committer then that counts as one of the
              reviews. In other words:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>OMC members need one approval from any committer</li>
                <li>Committers need one approval from a committer within the
                OMC</li>
                <li>Contributors without commit rights need two approvals,
                including one from the OMC.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This process may seem a little heavy, but OpenSSL is a large,
              complicated codebase, and we think two reviews help prevent
              security bugs, as well as disseminate knowledge to the growing
              contributor base.</p>

              <p>Contributors without commit rights cannot formally approve
              patches but are nevertheless welcome to comment on submissions
              and do technical reviews. We always value another pair of eyes,
              and volunteering for reviews counts favourably towards becoming
              a committer. As an author, we ask that you address all comments,
              even if you already have the necessary approvals.</p>
 
              <p>If you have trouble finding consensus on a difficult review,
              reach out to the OMC at
              <a href="mailto:openssl-team@openssl.org">openssl-team@openssl.org</a>
              (private, moderated) or committers at
              <a href="mailto:openssl-dev@openssl.org">openssl-dev@openssl.org</a>
              (public). On GitHub, you can reach OMC members at @openssl/team,
              and committers can be found at @openssl/dev.</p>

              <h2>Commit workflow</h2>
              <p>We do code reviews on GitHub. The
              <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">OpenSSL GitHub repository</a>
              is a mirror, so we do not merge on GitHub. When you become a
              committer, we'll send you instructions to get commit access to
              the main repository. To have handy links to review history, we
              record the reviewers and GitHub pull request IDs in commit
              headers. We have some helper scripts in the
              <a href="https://github.com/openssl/tools">tools repo</a>
              to add these headers automatically.</p>

              <p>We don't use merge commits.</p>

              <p>If at any point during development or review you discover
              a potential security issue, we ask that you report it to
              <a href="mailto:openssl-security@openssl.org"> openssl-security@openssl.org</a>
              and don't discuss it further in public. We review security
              sensitive patches privately, off GitHub. We do not currently
              have a way to open access to those reviews after the patches
              have been released.</p>

              <h2>A note on CLAs</h2>
              <p>All authors, including committers, must have current CLAs on
              file. A CLA is not required for trivial contributions (e.g. the
              fix of a spelling mistake). If all reviewers as well as the
              original author agree that the submission is trivial, the commit
              text should include "CLA: trivial."</p>
