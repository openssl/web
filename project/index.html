	    <p>
	    In this section we try to document as many of our
	    policies and procedures as possible.
	    We do this for two reasons:
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	      First, we want to to make sure everyone knows how the project is
	      run. For example, when we announce a forthcoming fix for a
	      high-severity bug, the
	      <a href="secpolicy.html">Security Policy</a> explains what
	      that means.</li>
	      <li>
	      Second, it helps us be consistent. For example,
	      the <a href="releasestrat.html">Release Strategy</a> defines the
	      plan of record of when, and how long, various releases will be
	      supported.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	    Put another way, by being as transparent as possible,
	    we hope to reduce the chance that people are surprised by
	    what we do, and we hope to help maintain predictable
	    behavior within the project.
	    </p>
            <p>
	    The <a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a> describes our overall
	    goals and plans for OpenSSL. It is a living document and is
	    expected to change over time. Objectives and dates should be
	    considered aspirational.
	    </p>

            The OpenSSL project is managed by the OpenSSL Management Committee
            (OMC), as defined by the <a href="omc-bylaws.html">project bylaws</a>.
            It is
            represented in most legal and formal capacities by the
            OpenSSL Software Foundation, a Delaware (US) non-profit corporation
            which has its own <a href="osf-bylaws.pdf">bylaws</a> as a legal
            document.
            Signing one of our CLA's grants certain rights to OSF.

	    We are pleased to mention that
            <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/54">we follow</a>
            the
	    <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org">best practices</a>
