# Welcome to OpenSSL!

The OpenSSL Project develops and maintains the OpenSSL software - a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and
secure communication. The project's technical decision making is managed by
the [OpenSSL Technical Committee](/community/otc.html) (OTC) and the project
governance is managed by the [OpenSSL Management Committee](/community/omc.html)
(OMC). The project operates under formal [Bylaws](/policies/omc-bylaws.html).

For more information about the team and community around the project, or to
start making your own contributions, start with the [community](/community)
page. To get the latest news, download the source, and so on, please see the
sidebar or the buttons at the top of every page.

OpenSSL is licensed under an Apache-style license, which basically means
that you are free to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial
purposes subject to some simple license conditions.

For a list of vulnerabilities, and the releases in which they were found and
fixes, see our [Vulnerabilities](news/vulnerabilities.html) page.
